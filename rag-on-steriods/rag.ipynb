As a company that has withstood the test of tough times and tougher terrains, we kept riding ahead confidently. Our strong business fundamentals, razor sharp focus, and robust strategic business approach have seen us through these years, and we have actually come out stronger and better. We have Rebalanced our strategic priorities, and that has allowed us to reorient our vision and approach to business, and is already making us stronger, more resilient to external challenges and absolutely future-ready. \\nAt Eicher Motors Limited, FY 2022 -23 \\nhas been a fantastic year across the \\nboard. We sa\\nw the stabilization of \\nsupply chain and markets, and made significant progress on all important initiatives, resulting in our best ever business and financial performance, both at Royal Enfield and VE Commercial Vehicles. We registered our highest ever revenues, EBITDA and Profit after Tax. This, we believe, is a strong testament to our vision, our direction and the capability of our\\xa0\\xa0people. \\nWhile we continue to solidify our \\nexisting business, we also have a sharp eye on the future. During the year, we made huge progress on our Electric Mobility plans. We now have close to a 100-member strong and highly capable team on the engineering and commercial side who are focused on building not just a distinct Royal Enfield electric motorcycle, but also a comprehensive electric vehicle business. We are also strengthening our technical know-how by partnering with like-minded people who have relevant experience in EVs. We’ve made a strategic investment in Stark Future, a spanish electric mobility company that is focused on and passionate about disrupting the EV mobility space. We see immense synergies in this partnership and our plan is to co-develop and leverage each other’s strengths. At VECV as well, we’ve remained highly focused on future ready solutions and clean alternative fuel strategy. We work very closely with our partners at Volvo on EV and alternate fuel solutions, as they bring immense capabilities and know-how in this area. We now have a robust range of EV trucks and buses, with more than 40 EV buses already plying the roads.\\n\"FY 2022-23 HAS BEEN THE BEST EVER BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, BOTH AT ROYAL ENFIELD AND VE COMMERCIAL VEHICLES.\"14\\nCORPORATE OVERVIEW\\nEICHER MOTORS LIMITED\\n\"THE COMPANY \\nREGISTERED ITS HIGHEST EVER SALES VOLUME AT 8,34,895 MOTORCYCLES, A 38.4% GROWTH OVER FY\\xa02021‑22, BEATING OUR PREVIOUS HIGH OF 2018-19\"\"CROSSED A MILESTONE, 1,00,000 MARK IN EXPORT SHIPMENTS\"\\nROYAL ENFIELD\\nFY 2022-23 was a fantastic year for Royal Enfield. Alongside some very successful new motorcycle launches, we also made significant gains in new initiatives, as we recorded our best ever performance. The company registered its highest ever sales volume at 8,34,895 motorcycles, a 38.4% growth over FY 2021-22, beating our previous highest of 2018-19. We’ve taken really giant strides in our international business, and have crossed a milestone 1,00,000 mark in export shipments. This is a very positive inflection point for us, and we believe we have a virtuous cycle now in international markets. In our non-motorcycling business we have a strong growth momentum and witnessed a growth of almost 32%\\xa0\\xa0y-o-y. \\nOur long term ambition of being a \\nglobal premium motorcycling brand from India, saw us introduce two new motorcycles during the year for global audiences. We launched the Hunter 350 - a stylish and peppy roadster, and the Super Meteor 650 - an absolutely gorgeous thoroughbred cruiser, inspired from our history of building amazing cruisers. Both these motorcycles are impeccably engineered, supremely refined and fun to ride, and beautifully designed to reflect their personalities and purpose. Since their launches in August 2022 and January 2023 respectively, the Hunter 350 and the Super Meteor 650 have received strong, positive endorsement from the best of the global motorcycling press and immense love and appreciation from consumers across the world. \\nLaunched in August 2022, the \\nHunter\\xa0350 is a refreshingly new, stylish, compact-yet-muscular motorcycle. \\nMade for an all new set of customers that loved our brand, but did not find the right kind of attitude within our portfolio, the Hunter 350 has all the character of a Royal Enfield, with the nimble agility of a roadster. The global launch and first media ride of the all-new Hunter 350 in Bangkok was like a breath of fresh air after almost two years of virtual launches. The feeling of riding with the world’s best experts and journalists across the streets of Bangkok was simply marvelous. The motorcycle has hit all the right chords with consumers and has earned worthy accolades from motorcycling experts across the globe. We have won innumerous, very prestigious awards for the Hunter 350 including the most coveted Indian Motorcycle of The Year (IMOTY) Award - our third IMOTY in the last five years. In a little more than six months from launch, we had a young and ‘vibing’, 1,00,000+ strong Hunter tribe in India. What amazes me is the fact that as we near the first year anniversary of the Hunter 350, we will have more than 2,00,000 motorcycles on the road. The Hunter is an amazingly fun motorcycle to ride and we are confident that the Hunter tribe will keep growing as newer customers keep discovering this motorcycle. \\nContinuing on Royal Enfield’s heritage \\nof building superlative cruisers, we launched the all-new Super Meteor 650 - a quintessential, thoroughbred, retro cruiser. After the launch event in Rajasthan in January this year, the motorcycle has received excellent reviews from press around the world. Built on the globally successful Royal Enfield 650-Twin platform, with an all-new chassis, the Super Meteor takes Royal Enfield’s legacy of building exquisite cruisers a notch higher. More importantly, it makes long -distance cruising so much easier and more accessible for anyone; and thereby has the potential to expand the category. Since January, we have launched the Super Meteor in Europe, Australia, New Zealand and will soon be launching in the APAC region and Americas as well. There has been unprecedented interest for the Super Meteor from across the world, and we started receiving bookings \\nfrom Europe and other markets even before the retail launches. \\nJust as our motorcycles have been \\nfinding immense appeal among global consumers, our business in markets outside India has grown considerably as well. It has been close to a decade now since we began our strategic foray into international markets. Choosing our markets carefully, our initial objective was to set a strong foundation in these new markets by building strong resonance for the brand and building the pure motorcycling ecosystem, creating a capable team and strong distribution, and building deep customer understanding and connect. We have now been able to leverage that strong base and foundation for sustained brand and business growth in international markets. Over the last 10 years, we have witnessed significant growth in our business, as well as in our global riding community, and we closed FY 2022-23 with stunning results. \\nIn 2022-23 Royal Enfield recorded its \\nhighest ever exports by crossing the 1,00,000 export shipments milestone. Despite the macro backdrop, our retail growth in international markets ranged between 27% to 45% across regions in FY 2022-23. Our overall growth is also complemented by strong increase in market share across regions. In the Americas, we now have more than 7% in the 250cc-750cc segment, and close to 9% in the Asia-Pacific region, Europe and in the Middle-East. We are now the highest selling motorcycle brand in the 250cc-750cc mid-size segment in India, Korea and in the UK; #2 in Thailand, and #3 in France, Italy and Australia.  In India, we have close to 90% market share in the mid-size segment. We\\'ve outperformed the market and have recorded a significant increase in market shares in the more than 125cc segment as well with 31.3%, and with 7.2% in the overall motorcycle segment - our best ever. With a strong \\n15\\nINTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2022-23\\nline-up of motorcycles, and with our \\nexpanding network of premium stores and retail touchpoints across the world, I believe we have huge headroom for growth in international markets.\\nMirroring our journey in international \\nbusiness, has been our journey on quality, and both have been remarkably commendable. Our new motorcycles starting with the 650 Twins in 2018, the Meteor 350 and the Classic 350 in 2020-21, and the new Hunter and Super Meteor, all have achieved a new level of quality, refinement and overall finesse, that is best-in-class globally. Today, Royal Enfield motorcycles are designed, developed and manufactured in state-of-the-art facilities and are comparable to the best in the world. This, combined with our constantly improving and intense product development and quality processes, within our plants and with our suppliers, has resulted in a step change in our engine quality, level of refinement and the sheer premiumness of our fit and finish, which has been appreciated by international experts. The Hunter and the Super Meteor have been an outcome of this same journey. Not surprising then that these motorcycles have been able to capture the imagination of global audiences so quickly. At the Frost and Sullivan’s India Manufacturing Excellence Award 2022, our Vallam Vadagal manufacturing facility was recognised as the ‘Future Ready Factory of the Year’.\\nAs we are committed to constantly \\nelevating our product offering, we are equally invested in enhancing our rider and consumer experiences; and we did just that at the 12th edition of Rider Mania. Reimagining the concept with a fresh vision, we returned to the shores of Goa after a break of two years. Themed ‘Into the Motoverse’, the mega event brought together Royal Enfield’s Pure Motorcycling ethos with new fun, engaging and thought provoking programming, including races, competitions, expert sessions and concerts. We had about 14,000 registered participants, more than 54,000 attendees across 10 hotspots in the city, and customers, dealers, and media from across the world, as Goa reverberated with the sound of Royal Enfield motorcycles for 3 days.\\nDuring the year, we curated a special \\nproject that showcased our undying love for handcrafted motorcycles. We unveiled the absolutely gorgeous 1:3 Classic Collectible models, to an overwhelmingly unprecedented response from passionate enthusiasts. The bespoke, limited edition Classic collectible is handcrafted to precision, sharing and resembling actual motorcycle parts, with multiple moving parts identical to the original. This project celebrates the unique craftsmanship that Royal Enfield is known for, and pays homage to the iconic Royal Enfield Classic 500. We unveiled these models at Rider Mania and almost immediately the entire set was sold off.\\nWith a focus on sustainability and with \\na mission to leave every place better, we have been working on streamlining our strategic initiatives and outreach programme. With an ambitious goal of promoting and safeguarding the Intangible Cultural Heritage of India, starting with the Himalayas, we announced our partnership with the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization - UNESCO. Given our long relationship with the Himalayas, stretching back over three decades, our ambition is to partner with 100 Himalayan communities to adopt sustainable living practices by 2030.

Apart from its incredible heritage of monuments, a substantial part of India’s cultural heritage consists of an extraordinarily dynamic array of living heritage. This includes traditions of music, dance, theatre, storytelling, festivals, and rituals. Intangible cultural heritage is directly linked to livelihoods. For instance, large number of women in rural India are engaged in weaving and the production of handicrafts, and India’s handloom and crafts sector have emerged as one of the country’s largest employers and facilitators for income generation in rural areas.\\nIndeed, the 2030 Agenda for \\nSustainable Development recognises that culture can contribute to economic growth, sustainable consumption and production, and the growth of sustainable settlements.

With more members of our motorcycling community heading there, Royal Enfield is working in this iconic landscape to promote sustainable tourism and build resilient communities.

In FY 2022-23, the Indian economy continues to show strong resilience to external shocks. As per National Statistical Office (NSO), India’s GDP growth during FY 2022-23 is estimated at 7.0% as against 9.1% in FY\\xa02021-22. However, the inflation continues to remain higher at 5.66% in March 2023 as the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) increased the repo rate by 250 basis points in FY 2022-23 as a countermeasure.Higher capital investment, increasing pace of infrastructure development, the rebound of private consumption, digitalisation, and revival in credit growth continues to reflect India’s long runway for growth. Rising consumer incomes and purchasing power have potential to sustain the rapid growth in household consumption, boosting the demand for goods and services across industries.In the Management Discussion and Analysis, all the numbers pertaining to Eicher Motors Limited (“EML”) refer to consolidated numbers.\\n115\\nINTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2022-23\\nGlobal Economy\\nThe global economy navigated through a turbulent year \\n2022 caused by geo-political issues, supply chain disruptions, higher inflation, and the sharp rise in central bank rates. However, global economic conditions started showing signs of stabilisation in early 2023, with slight moderation in projected global inflation to 7.0% in 2023 as compared to 8.7% in 2022 (as per OECD). The United States economy reported the GDP growth at 2.1% in 2022 on the back of a mild increase in private investment and gradual pick-up in consumer spending. The European economy recorded 2.7% GDP growth in 2022. Further, the GDP of Australia and New Zealand grew at 3.7% and 2.4% respectively in 2022.\\nINDUSTRY OVERVIEW\\nIndian two-wheeler and motorcycle \\nindustry\\nThe Indian automotive industry has seen a healthy revival in \\nFY 2022-23 (Year ending March 2023), aided by a recovery in the economic activities and recovery in mobility post COVID impacted period (FY 2021-22). However, the two-wheeler segment is yet to reach the pre-pandemic levels as the industry navigates through high inflation, supply chain hurdles, sharp increase in input costs, and the rising cost of ownership due to regulatory changes.\\nAccording to the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers \\n(SIAM), the two-wheelers segment grew by a relatively moderate 17% YoY growth, after witnessing de-growth for the previous three consecutive years. The domestic sales of two-wheelers in FY 2022-23 were 15.9 million units as against 13.5 million units in FY 2021-22. Motorcycle sales increased by 14% YoY to 10.2 million units, while scooter sales grew over 25% YoY to 5.2 million units. The sales of Electric two-wheelers in India grew over two-and-half-fold to 7,28,090 units in FY\\xa02022–23 over the previous fiscal, aided by subsidies offered by the government(s) and growing penetration of electric vehicles across segments.The long-term two-wheeler growth potential in India is backed by the relatively young population, rising incomes, wide availability of credit and financing options, and boost to the local manufacturing ecosystem.\\nGlobal two-wheeler and motorcycle \\nindustry\\nThe global two-wheeler industry faced multiple macro \\neconomic headwinds in 2022 such as supply chain disruptions, inflationary pressures, higher interest rates, and dampening consumer sentiment. The semiconductor shortage has led to a production shortfall, especially in the premium segment of motorcycles. According to the SIAM, the exports of two-wheelers from India recorded a 17.8% decline to 3.7 million units in FY 2022-23 from 4.4 million units in FY 2021- 22.\\nEML OVERVIEW\\nEicher Motors Limited (EML) (Bloomberg- EIM: IN) is an Indian, multinational automotive company that has diversified interests in motorcycle and commercial vehicle manufacturing.

Apart from manufacturing Eicher and Volvo Trucks and Buses, VECV is engaged in exclusive distribution of Volvo Trucks in India, engine manufacturing and exports for Volvo Group, non-automotive engines and Eicher engineering component\\xa0\\xa0business.In operation since July 2008, the synergy with Volvo group has seen a strong track record in the last 15 years as VECV strives to be recognised as the industry leader driving modernisation in commercial transportation in India and the developing world. The Company has strengthened its credibility through retail excellence, oriented front-end processes, and focus on uptime. The Company has expanded its retail network and now has more than 800 touchpoints across the country and has retained its No.1 position in the dealer satisfaction survey conducted by FADA. \\n133\\nINTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2022-23\\nThe Commercial Vehicle Industry\\nThe year 2022 had its share of ups and downs and threw some \\nfresh challenges for everyone in the industry. While the effect of the pandemic subsided across the globe, the geopolitical situation in Europe added to uncertainty in supply chains across the world impacting the cost of raw materials and their availability. Despite these challenges, the CV industry has seen growth in FY 2022-23 owing to the government\\'s emphasis on infrastructure, growth-oriented policies, pent-up replacement demand, and macroeconomic expansion in the second half of the year. Additionally, an outlay of Rs. 10 lakh crores for infrastructure development alongside 100 new projects for last-mile connectivity will further boost the CV industry. \\nVECV Performance\\nIn the financial year 2022-23, VECV saw a 40% growth over the previous year and outgrew the Industry registering sales of 79,623 units. The growth has been robust and consistent during the year and the Company has been able to sustain its leading position in light and medium-duty trucks while increasing market shares in the Buses and HD Trucks segments. The exports, however, saw a decline of 41% owing to geo-political and macroeconomic challenges in the International markets. \\nIn FY 2022-23, the Company achieved its highest-ever Eicher \\nTrucks and Buses sales of 77,760 units beating its previous peak of 71,743 units in FY 2018-19. In the Heavy Duty trucks segment, the Company has sold 20,675 units (previous peak of 14,507 units in FY 2018-19) gaining a market share of 8.3% in the segment. Higher spending on infrastructure and road construction, higher mining activity of coal and iron ore, higher demand in the FMCG and E-Commerce segments, and the shift toward more efficient logistics driving the replacement demand have been some of the major factors driving the growth in the\\xa0\\xa0segment. \\nIn the Light and Medium duty trucks segment, the Company \\nhas sold 37,318 units (previous peak of 34,546 units in FY\\xa02018-19) gaining a market share of 31.5% in the segment.Last-mile connectivity has seen sustained growth due to rapid growth in E-Commerce post the pandemic which is driving the growth of the segment. The Company has strengthened its offering in the segment with the new Pro 2049 12ft variant bus. The industry has also seen a shift toward higher gross vehicle weight (GVW) driving the demand for medium-duty trucks which now contribute to almost half of the LMD trucks. Pro\\xa03018 is the latest addition to our MD trucks range which has now also been acknowledged as the ICV Cargo Carrier year of the year.  \\nIn the bus segment, VECV sold 14,924 units (previous peak \\nof 12,270 units in FY 2018-19) and has maintained its place as the 2nd largest player in the segment with 23.8% market share owing to its strong performances in the Light and Medium Duty and Private Heavy Duty buses thanks to the class-leading products we have introduced like our intercity coaches. The increase in mobility to schools and offices, and intercity travel picking up have been driving factors in the  bus\\xa0\\xa0segment.  \\nThe Company has sold its highest-ever Volvo trucks of 1,710 \\nunits beating its previous peak of 1,242 units in FY 2018-19.

PROVIDE THE EXECUTIVE SUMMARY ALONG WITH WEB-LINK(S) OF IMPACT ASSESSMENT OF   \\nCSR PROJECTS CARRIED OUT IN PURSUANCE OF SUB-RULE (3) OF RULE 8, IF APPLICABLE:\\n  Below is the executive summary of the impact assessment of CSR projects carried out in pursu ance of sub-rule (3) of rule \\n8 of the Companies (Corporate Social Responsibility Policy) Rules, 2014. The detailed impact assessment report(s) can be \\naccessed on the website of the Company at https://www.eicher.in/investors-overview/corporate-governance/csr\\n (A)  Holistic Village\\n Development of Community, Vallam Village, Tamil Nadu:  Project implementation agency of \\nthe Company - Eicher Group Foundation (EGF), in partnership with the Habitat for Humanity India Trust, has created significant positive impact on the lives of the people of Vallam village in Tamil Nadu through different interventions with respect to Sanitation, Safe Drinking water, Education, and Water conservation. This was demonstrated through an Impact Assessment Study carried out by Soulace Consulting Pvt. Ltd., that used a mixed approach of quantitative and qualitative surveys to ascertain factual and reliable outcomes of the project related to Holistic Village Development of Community in Vallam Village. \\n  \\n The study revealed that EGF supported the construction o\\nf individual household toilets, setting up of community \\nRO water purifying plant and rooftop rainwater harvesting structures and renovation of school infrastructure. The qualitative aspect of the study showed that the beneficiaries of this project, the villagers who largely came from rural marginalised communities and the members of the village Panchayat, were happy with these initiatives. In fact 51% of the respondents work as daily wage earners while 26% hold employment in private jobs. Most of the respondents, around 69%, have monthly incomes ranging from Rs. 5,000 to Rs. 10,000.\\n  \\n As a result of the construction of individual household toile\\nts, the villagers declared that open defecation in the village \\nvicinity, which was a problem in the past, has reduced significantly; 92% of the toilets constructed were functional while the remaining 8% needed some maintenance work and were non-functional. The respondents also said that the toilets that had been constructed were of good quality. The issue of open defecation however has not been eradicated completely due to the lack of proper toilet facilities at the workplace, as a result of which people continued to defecate openly during working hours, said 34% of the respondents. \\n  \\n The study shows that all\\n beneficiaries relied on the newly set up RO Water ATM that provides clean and safe drinking \\nwater at Rs. 5 for 10 litres. Approximately, 60% of the respondents said that the water received at the RO Water ATM is excellent quality. Prior to the setting up of this ATM, the villagers relied on hand pumps and water supplied by water tankers for their daily needs. This resulted in significant suffering through the summer months when clean and safe drinking water would be in short supply. \\n  \\n To offset the seasonal scarcity of w\\nater, EGF has also set up rooftop rainwater harvesting facilities in 328 houses in \\nVallam. With this infrastructure in place, villagers will be able to collect and store rainwater through proper channels resulting in a usable supply in their wells when the monsoon showers set in. The setting up of rainwater harvesting facilities will also reduce mud in the village vicinity and make roads and pathways more usable through the rainy season. \\n  \\n The study also showed that student attendance at the RCM\\n schools has increased as a result of interventions with \\nrespect to renovation and repair of school infrastructure. Constructions of sanitation blocks, hand wash units and renovation of the kitchens have resulted in general happiness among the school teachers. They also said that the facilities were good and were being used regularly. \\n (B) \\n Royal Enfield Academy for Skill Development: \\nThe Royal Enfield Academy for Skill Development is an initiative \\nthat aims to train students with diplomas, in the age group 19 to 26 years. The objective is to develop vocational skill with the goal of 100% placement. Of the people who have completed their training, 62% are currently employed in the automobile trade with 51% earning Rs. 12,000 per month and 12.9% are able to financially contribute to their families. The majority of employed beneficiaries have a work experience varying from 6 months to 1 year. The qualitative aspect of the study carried out by Soulace Consulting Pvt. Ltd. showed that 78% of the students and trainees feel that the syllabus is well structured while 72% agree that the timings of the training schedule is convenient. The month long training programme has fixed classes totalling 8 hours daily, with training being a mix of theory and practical application.\\n (C)  \\n School Education: Company’\\ns supported Shikshak Pehal Programme (SPP) has been delivering quality education to \\nmarginalized children living in remote villages of Thanagazi and Umrain blocks of the Alwar district, for over 23 years. Bodhshalas and Learning Centres are running with enrolment of approximately 5446 students from pre-school to grade eight.\\n  \\n Impact assessment of said program was carried out by CSR Box and assessment period is from 2019 to\\n 2022. The study \\nadopted a mixed methodology i.e. quantitative and qualitative approach. The study used the National Education Policy 2020 framework - Access, Equity, Quality, Affordability and Accountability. School quality checklist and evaluation on \\n180\\nSTATUTORY REPORTS\\nEICHER MOTORS LIMITED\\nrubrics were used to identify the quality standards. Adopting a 360-degree approach, three research designs were \\nadministered across the study - descriptive, experimental and cross sectional.\\n  \\n Overall, the study found that SPP is an inclusive programm\\ne with enrolment of 39% OBC, 25% SC, 20% ST and 16% GEN \\ncategory students. Delivery of education continued in community places and Shiksha Ghars throughout pandemic. In all, 88% of enrolled students attended classes during pandemic. Oral lessons (95%), w orksheets (89%) and textbooks \\n(26%) were used as teaching material during classes during pandemic. T eachers played a crucial part in maintaining the \\nproper execution of this programme. All teachers interviewed had undergone extensive training to adopt new learning methods in teaching. Over 95% teachers feel highly motivated to teach every day in Bodhshalas and Learning Centres. 89% teachers from category A Bodhshalas agreed that lesson delivery became better using smartboards.

Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the ‘Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements’ section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with \\nthe ‘Code of Ethics’ issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the standalone financial statements.\\nKEY AUDIT MATTERS\\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements for the financial year ended March 31, 2023. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context.\\nWe have determined the matters described below to be \\nthe key audit matters to be communicated in our report. We have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the standalone financial statements. The results of our audit procedures, including the procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying standalone financial statements.\\nKey audit matters How our audit addressed the key audit matter\\nIntangible assets capitalized or under development (Refer to the accounting estimates and judgements in Note 3 and Note 7 to \\nthe standalone financial statements)\\nThe Company has various internally generated intangible \\nprojects under development. Initial recognition of the expenditure under these projects are based on assessing each project in relation to specific recognition criteria that needs to be met for capitalization.  In addition, the management also assess indication of impairment of the carrying value of assets which requires management judgment and assumptions as affected by future market or economic developments.\\nDue to the materiality of the assets under development \\nrecognized and the level of management judgement involved, initial recognition and measurement of internally generated intangible assets has been considered as a key audit matter.Our audit procedures included the following:\\n\\uf077\\n We read the Company\\'s research and development \\nexpenditure accounting policies to assess compliance with Ind AS 38 “Intangible Assets”.\\n\\uf077\\n We performed test of control\\n over management \\nprocess of identifying and capitalizing the development expenditure in accordance with the accounting principles of capitalization of expenditure on internally generated intangible assets as per Ind AS 38 such as technical feasibility of the project, intention and ability to complete the intangible asset, ability to use or sell the asset, generation of future economic benefits and the ability to measure costs reliably.\\n211\\nINTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2022-23\\nKey audit matters How our audit addressed the key audit matter\\n\\uf077 We performed test of details of development expenditure \\ncapitalized by reviewing the key assumptions including the authori.zation of the stage of the project in the development phase, the accuracy of costs included and assessing the useful economic life attributed to the asset. In addition, we considered whether any indicators of impairment were present by understanding the business rationale for projects.\\n\\uf077\\n We tested th\\ne disclosure relating to research \\nand development expenditure in the standalone financial statements.\\nRevenue Recognition (Refer to the accounting policies in Note 3 to the standalone financial statements)\\nRevenue from the sale of goods is recognised upon the \\ntransfer of control of the goods to the customer, usually on delivery of goods. The Company uses a variety of shipment terms across its operating markets and this has an impact on the timing of revenue recognition. There is a risk that revenue could be recognised in the incorrect period for sales transactions occurring on and around the year end therefore revenue recognition has been identified as a key audit matter.Our audit procedures included the following:\\n\\uf077\\n We read the Company\\'s revenue recognition accounting \\npolicies to assess compliance with Ind AS 115 “Revenue from contracts with customers”. \\n\\uf077\\n We performed test of control\\ns of management\\'s process \\nof recognizing the revenue from sales of goods with regard to the timing of the revenue recognition as per the sales terms with the customers.\\n\\uf077\\n We performed test of details of the sales transactions testing based on a representative sampling of the sales orders to test that the related revenues and trade receiv\\nables are recorded taking into consideration the \\nterms and conditions of the sale orders, including the shipping terms.\\n\\uf077\\n We also performed audit procedures relating to revenue recognition by agreeing deliveries occurring around the year end to supporting documentation to establish that sales and corresponding trade receiv\\nables are properly \\nrecorded in the correct period.\\nOTHER INFORMATION\\nThe Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the \\nother information. The other information comprises the information included in the Annual report, but does not include the standalone financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.\\nOur opinion on the standalone financial statements does not \\ncover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\\nIn connection with our audit of the standalone financial \\nstatements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether such other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.RESPONSIBILITIES OF MANAGEMENT FOR THE \\nSTANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\nThe Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the \\nmatters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation of these standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance including other comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in equity of the Company in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating \\n212\\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS (STANDALONE)\\nEICHER MOTORS LIMITED\\neffectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of \\nthe accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\\nIn preparing the standalone financial statements, \\nmanagement is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\\nThose Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing \\nthe Company’s financial reporting process.\\nAUDITOR’S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR \\nTHE AUDIT OF THE STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about \\nwhether the standalone financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these standalone financial statements.\\nAs part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise \\nprofessional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\\n\\uf077\\n Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement \\nof the standalone financial statements, whether due to fraud or error\\n, design and perform audit procedures \\nresponsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\\n\\uf077\\n Obtain an understanding of internal control relev\\nant to \\nthe audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Company has adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.\\uf077\\n Evaluate the\\n appropriateness of accounting policies \\nused and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\\n\\uf077\\n Conclude on the appropriateness of management’\\ns use \\nof the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.\\n\\uf077\\n Evaluate the\\n overall presentation, structure and content \\nof the standalone financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the standalone financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a \\nstatement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with \\ngovernance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the standalone financial statements for the financial year ended March 31, 2023 and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\\nREPORT ON OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY \\n REQUIREMENTS\\n1.

Involvement of external valuers is decided upon annually by the Company. Selection criteria include market knowledge, reputation, independence and whether professional standards are maintained. The Company decides, after discussions with the Company’s external valuers, which valuation techniques and inputs to use for each case.\\n At each reporting date, the Company analyses the movements in the values of assets and liabilities which are required to be re-measured or re-assessed as per the Company’\\ns accounting \\npolicies. For this analysis, the Company verifies the major inputs applied in the latest valuation by agreeing the information in the valuation computation to contracts and other relevant documents.\\n The Company also compares the change in the fair value of each asset and liability with relev\\nant \\nexternal sources to determine whether the change is reasonable.\\n3.3 \\n Revenue from contract with customers\\n Revenue from contracts with customers is recognised when control of the goods or services are transferred to the customer at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or ser\\nvices. The Company has \\ngenerally concluded that it is the principal in its revenue arrangements, except for the agency services below, because it typically controls the goods or services before transferring them to the customer.\\n229\\nNOTES\\nFORMING PART OF THE STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2023\\nALL AMOUNTS ARE IN RS. CRORES UNLESS OTHERWISE STATED\\nINTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2022-23\\n Sale of goods\\n Revenue from sale of goods is recognised at \\nthe point in time when control of the goods is transferred to the customer, generally on deliver\\ny of the goods.\\n The Company considers whether there are other promises in the contract that are separate performance obligations to which a portion of the transaction price needs to be allocated (e.g., warranties, Road Side Assistance (RSA), F\\nree Service Coupons (FSC), \\netc.). In determining the transaction price for the sale of goods, the Company considers the effects of variable consideration, the existence of significant financing components, non-cash consideration, and consideration payable to the customer (if any).\\n Variable consideration\\n If the consideration in a contract includes a variable amount, the Company estimates the amount of consideration to which it will be entitled in exchange for transferring the goods to the customer\\n. The variable consideration \\nis estimated at contract inception and constrained until it is highly probable that a significant revenue reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur when the associated uncertainty with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. Some contracts for the sale of traded goods provide customers with a right of return for which, the consideration is estimated based on goods expected to be returned. The rights of return give rise to variable consideration. For goods that are expected to be returned, instead of revenue, the Company recognises a refund liability.\\n  Warranty obligations\\n The Company typically provides warranties for general repairs of defects that existed at the time of sale, as required by la\\nw. \\nThese assurance-type warranties are accounted for under Ind AS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets. Refer to the accounting policy on warranty provisions in section 3.16 Provisions.\\n The Company provides a one to three years warranty bey\\nond fixing defects that existed at the time of sale. These service-type warranties \\nare sold either separately or bundled together with the sale of goods. Contracts for bundled sales of goods and a service-type warranty comprise two performance obligations because the promises to transfer the goods and to provide the service-type warranty are capable of being distinct. Using the relative stand-alone selling price method, a portion of the transaction price is allocated to the service-type warranty and recognised as a contract liability. Revenue is recognised on the service-type warranty to the extent of actual cost incurred on rendering the warranty service.\\n Agency services\\n In contracts where the Company acts as an agent, the revenue is recorded at the net amount that the Company retains for its agency services.\\n Trade receivables\\n A receivable represents the Company’\\ns right to \\nan amount of consideration that is unconditional (i.e., only the passage of time is required before payment of the consideration is due). Refer to accounting policies of financial assets in section 3.17 Financial instruments – initial recognition and subsequent measurement.\\n Contract liabilities\\n A contract liability is the obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the Company has received consideration (or an amount of consideration is due) from the customer\\n. If a customer pays consideration \\nbefore the Company transfers goods or services to the customer, a contract liability is recognised when the payment is made or the payment is due (whichever is earlier). Contract liabilities are recognised as revenue when the Company performs under the contract.\\n Dividend and interest income\\n Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholder\\'s right to receive payment has been established.\\n Interest income from a financial asset is recognised when it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Company and the amount of income can be measured reliably. \\n230\\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS (STANDALONE)\\nNOTES\\nFORMING PART OF THE STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2023\\nALL AMOUNTS ARE IN RS. CRORES UNLESS OTHERWISE STATED\\nEICHER MOTORS LIMITED\\nInterest income is accrued on, time basis, by \\nreference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that asset\\'s net carrying amount on initial recognition.\\n3.4\\n Leases\\n The Company assesses at the contract inception, whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. That is, if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.\\n As a lessee\\n The Company applies a single recognition and measurement approach for all leases, except for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets. The Company recognises lease liabilities to make lease payments and right-of-use assets representing the right to use the underlying assets.\\n i)  Right-of-use assets\\n  \\n The Company recognises right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date the underlying asset is av\\nailable for use). Right-of-use assets are \\nmeasured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received. Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:\\nBuildings 2 to 25 years\\nLand 99 years\\n  \\n If ownership of the leased asset transfers to the Company at the end of the lease term or the cost reflects the exercise of a purchase option, depreciation is calculated using the estimated useful \\nlife of the asset.\\n  \\n The right-of-use assets are also subject to impairment. Refer to the accounting policies in section 3.13 Impairment of non-financial assets.\\n ii) Lease Liabilities\\n  \\n At the commencement date of the lease, the Company recognises lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receiv\\nable, variable lease payments \\nthat depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. The lease payments also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by the Company and payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Company exercising the option to terminate. Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognised as expenses (unless they are incurred to produce inventories) in the period in which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs.\\n  \\n In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date because the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. A\\nfter the \\ncommencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the lease payments (e.g., changes to future payments resulting from a change in an index or rate used to determine such lease payments) or a change in the \\n231\\nNOTES\\nFORMING PART OF THE STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2023\\nALL AMOUNTS ARE IN RS. CRORES UNLESS OTHERWISE STATED\\nINTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2022-23\\nassessment of an option to purchase the \\nunderlying asset.\\n iii)  \\n Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets\\n  \\n  The Company applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to its short-term leases of buildings and others (i.e., those leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the commencement date and do not contain a purchase option). Lease payments on short-term leases and leases of low-v\\nalue \\nassets are recognised as expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\\n As a lessor\\n  Leases in which the Company transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an underlying asset are classified as finance leases.\\n  Leases in which the Company does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an asset are classified as operating leases. Rental income arising is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease terms. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carr\\nying amount of the leased \\nasset and recognised over the lease term on the same basis as rental income. Contingent rents are recognised as revenue in the period in which they are earned.\\n  In case of finance lease, as a lessor, the company recognises, at the commencement date, assets held under a finance lease in its balance sheet and present them as a receiv\\nable \\nat an amount equal to the net investment in the lease. Interest rate implicit is used to measure the net investment in the lease. Initial direct costs, other than those incurred by the company, are included in the initial measurement of the net investment in the lease and reduce the amount of income recognised over the lease term. The interest rate implicit in the lease is arrived in such a way that the initial direct costs are included automatically in the net investment in the lease.  At the commencement date, the lease payments \\nincluded in the measurement of the net investment in the lease comprise the following payments for the right to use the underlying asset during the lease term that are not received at the commencement date:\\n  (a) fixed payments less any lease incentives payable, (b) v\\nariable lease payments that \\ndepend on an index or a rate initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date; (c) any residual value guarantees provided to the lessor by the lessee, a party related to the lessee or a third party unrelated to the lessor that is financially capable of discharging the obligations under the guarantee, (d) the exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option and (e) payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising an option to terminate the lease.\\n  At the commencement date, as a manufacturer or dealer the Company recognises the following for each of its finance leases:\\n  (a) revenue being the fair value of the underlying asset, or\\n, if lower, the present value of the lease \\npayments accruing to the lessor, discounted using a market rate of interest; (b) the cost of sale being the cost, or carrying amount if different, of the underlying asset less the present value of the unguaranteed residual value; and (c) selling profit or loss (being the difference between revenue and the cost of sale) in accordance with its policy for outright sales to which Ind AS 115 applies. The company also recognise selling profit or loss on a finance lease at the commencement date, regardless of whether the company transfers the underlying asset as described in Ind AS 115.\"\\n  The company as a manufacturer or dealer lessor recognises as an expense costs incurred in connection with obtaining a finance lease at the commencement date because they are mainly related to earning the manufacturer or dealer’s selling profit. Costs incurred by the company in connection with obtaining a finance lease are excluded from the definition of initial direct costs and, thus, are excluded from the net investment in the lease.\\n232\\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS (STANDALONE)\\nNOTES\\nFORMING PART OF THE STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2023\\nALL AMOUNTS ARE IN RS. CRORES UNLESS OTHERWISE STATED\\nEICHER MOTORS LIMITED\\n Subsequent measurement:\\n  The company recognises finance income over \\nthe lease term, based on a pattern reflecting a constant periodic rate of return on the lessor’s net investment in the lease.\\n  The finance income is allocated over the lease term on a systematic and rational basis. The company applies the lease payments relating to the period against the gross investment in the lease to reduce both the principal and the unearned finance income. The company applies the derecognition and impairment requirements in Ind AS 109 to the net investment in the lease. The company reviews regularly estimated unguaranteed residual values used in computing the gross investment in the lease. If there has been a reduction in the estimated unguaranteed residual v\\nalue, the company revises the income \\nallocation over the lease term and recognises immediately any reduction in respect of amounts accrued.\\n3.5\\n For\\neign currencies\\n  The financial statements are presented in Indian Rupees, which is also the functional currency of the Company. In preparing the financial statements of the Company\\n, transactions in \\ncurrencies other than the Company\\'s functional currency (foreign currencies) are recognised at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions.\\n  At the end of each reporting period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prev\\nailing at that date.\\n  Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded by the foreign operation at the functional currency spot rates at the date the transaction first qualifies for recognition. In respect of foreign operation, the assets and liabilities are translated into INR at the rate of exchange prev\\nailing at the reporting date and \\ntheir statement of profit and loss at the rates prevailing on the date of the transactions. However, for practical reasons, the Company uses an average rate to translate the income and expense items, if the average approximates the actual rate at the date of the transaction.  Exchange differences arising on settlement or \\ntranslation of monetary items are recognised in the Statement of profit or loss with the exception of the following:\\n -  \\n Exchange differences arising on monetary items that forms part of a reporting entity’\\ns net investment in a foreign \\noperation are initially recognised in the financial statements of the Company in the other comprehensive income. These exchange differences are reclassified from equity (Foreign currency translation reserve) to profit or loss on disposal of the net investment.\\n -  \\n Tax charges and credits attributable to exchange differences on those monetar\\ny \\nitems are also recorded in Other Comprehensive Income (OCI).\\n  Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the dates of the initial transactions.\\n  Non-monetary items measured at fair v\\nalue \\nin a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value is determined. The gain or loss arising on translation of non-monetary items measured at fair value is treated in line with the recognition of the gain or loss on the change in fair value of the item (i.e., translation differences on items whose fair value gain or loss is recognised in OCI or profit or loss are also recognised in OCI or profit or loss, respectively).\\n3.6\\n Borrowing costs\\n Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.\\n All other borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.\\n233\\nNOTES\\nFORMING PART OF THE STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2023\\nALL AMOUNTS ARE IN RS.

When the grant relates to an expense item, it is recognised as income on a systematic basis over the periods that the related costs, for which it is intended to compensate, are expensed.\\n When the Company receives grant of non-monetary assets, the asset and the grant are recorded at fair v\\nalue amounts and released \\nto the statement of profit and loss over the expected useful life in a pattern of consumption of the benefit of the underlying asset, i.e., by equal annual instalments.\\n In the case of Export Promotion Capital Goods (‘EPCG’) grant, the Company recognise the grant in the statement of profit and loss on a systematic basis over the useful life of the assets.\\n3.8\\n Retirement and other employee benefits\\n Provident fund\\n (i) \\n The Company operates a scheme of provident fund for eligible employees, which is a defined benefit plan. Both the employee and the Company make monthly contributions to the provident fund plan equal to a specified percentage of the covered employee’s salar\\ny. \\nThe Company contributes a part of the contributions to the “Eicher Executive Provident Fund Trust”. The rate at which the annual interest is payable to the beneficiaries by the trust is being administered by the Government. The Company has an obligation to make good the shortfall, if any, between the return from the investments of the trust and the notified interest rate.\\n  \\n The cost of providing benefits under above mentioned defined benefit plan is determined using the projected unit credit method with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date, which recognizes each period of ser\\nvice as giving rise to additional unit \\nof employee benefit entitlement and measures each unit separately to build up \\nthe final obligation.\\n (ii)  \\n The employees, who are not covered under the scheme stated in 3.8 (i) above, are covered in a defined contribution scheme wherein their portion of provident fund is contributed to the government administered provident fund. The Company has no obligation, other than the contribution payable to the provident fund. The Company recognizes contribution pay\\nable to the provident \\nfund scheme as expenditure, when an employee renders the related service.\\n Gratuity\\n The Company operates a defined benefit gratuity plan, which requires contributions to be made to a separately administered fund.\\n For defined benefit plans, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial v\\naluations \\nbeing carried out at the end of each annual reporting period.\\n Re-measurements, comprising actuarial gains and losses and the return on plan assets (excluding net interest), is reflected immediately in the balance sheet with a charge or credit recognised in other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. Re-measurements recognised in other comprehensive income is reflected immediately in retained earnings and is not reclassified to profit or loss. Net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate at the beginning of the period to the net defined benefit liability or asset.\\n Defined benefit costs are categorised as follows:\\n \\uf077  \\n service cost (including current ser\\nvice \\ncost, past service cost, as well as gains and losses or curtailments and settlements);\\n \\uf077 net interest expense or income; and\\n \\uf077  re-measurement\\n234\\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS (STANDALONE)\\nNOTES\\nFORMING PART OF THE STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2023\\nALL AMOUNTS ARE IN RS.

Any surplus resulting from this calculation is limited to the present v\\nalue of \\nany economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plans.\\n Short-term and other long-term employee benefits\\n A liability is recognised for benefits accruing to employees in respect of wages and salaries, in \\nthe period the related ser\\nvice is rendered at the \\nundiscounted amount of the benefits expected to be paid in exchange for that service.\\n Liabilities recognised in respect of short-term employee benefits are measured at the undiscounted amount of the benefits expected to be paid in exchange for the related service.\\n Liabilities recognised in respect of other long-term employee benefits such as annual leave and sick lea\\nve are measured at the present \\nvalue of the estimated future cash outflows expected to be made by the Company in respect of services provided by employees up to the reporting date.\\n3.9\\n Share-based payment arrangements\\n Employees (including senior executives) of the Company receive remuneration in the form of share-based payments, whereby employees render services as consideration for equity instruments (equity-settled transactions).\\n Equity-settled share-based payments to employees are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments at the grant date. Details regarding the determination of the fair v\\nalue of equity-settled share-based \\ntransactions are set out in note no. 49. That cost is recognised, together with a \\ncorresponding increase in share-based payment (SBP) reserves in equity\\n, over the \\nperiod in which the performance and/or service conditions are fulfilled in employee benefits expense. The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Company’s best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. The statement of profit and loss expense or credit for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that period and is recognised in employee benefits expense.\\n The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of diluted earnings per share.\\n3.\\n10 Taxation\\n Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.\\n Current tax\\n The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year\\n. Taxable profit differs from \\nprofit before tax\\' as reported in the statement of profit and loss because of items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and items that are never taxable or deductible. The Company\\'s current tax is calculated using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.\\n Current income tax relating to items recognised outside profit or loss is recognised outside profit or loss (either in other comprehensive income or in equity). Current tax items are recognised in correlation to the underlying transaction either in OCI or directly in equity.

Where no internally-generated intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is recognised in the statement of profit and loss in the period in which it is incurred.\\n Subsequent to initial recognition, internally-generated intangible assets are reported at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, on the same basis as intangible assets that are acquired separately.\\n Derecognition of intangible assets\\n An intangible asset is derecognised on disposal, or when no future economic benefits are expected from use or disposal. Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset, measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset, and are recognised in profit or loss when the asset is derecognised.\\n Useful lives of intangible assets\\n Intangible assets comprising of product design, prototypes, etc., either acquired or internally developed are amortised over a period of 5 to 10 years, the estimated minimum useful life of the related products. Cost of software is amortised over a period of 3 years or less depending on the estimated useful life of asset. The useful lives for intangible assets are given below:Particulars Useful life (in years)\\nProduct designs, prototypes, etc. 5 to 10\\nComputer software 3\\n3.13  Impairment of non-financial assets\\n At the end of each reporting period, the \\nCompany assesses, whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and v\\nalue in use.\\n When it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of the cash- generating unit to which the asset belongs. When a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are also allocated to individual cash-generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest group of cash-generating units for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identified.\\n In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present v\\nalue using a pre-tax discount rate \\nthat reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. In determining fair value less costs of disposal, recent market transactions are taken into account. If no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used.\\n The Company bases its impairment calculation on detailed budgets and forecast calculations, which are prepared separately for each of the Company’s cash generating unit (CGU).\\n If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carr\\nying amount \\nof the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss. When an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or \\n238\\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS (STANDALONE)\\nNOTES\\nFORMING PART OF THE STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2023\\nALL AMOUNTS ARE IN RS.

A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss.\\n Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and intangible assets not yet av\\nailable for use are \\ntested for impairment at least annually, and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.\\n3.14\\n Investment property\\n Investment property is a property held to earn rentals and capital appreciation. Investment property is measured initially at cost, including transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, investment property is measured in accordance with Ind AS 16’s requirements for cost model. The Company depreciates building component of investment property over 30 years from the date of capitalisation.\\n Investment properties are derecognised either when they have been disposed of or when they are permanently withdra\\nwn from use and no \\nfuture economic benefit is expected from their disposal. The difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset is recognised in profit or loss in the period of derecognition.\\n3.15\\n Inventories\\n Inventories comprising Raw materials, w\\nork-in-\\nprogress, stores and spares, loose tools, traded goods and finished goods are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost includes cost of purchase and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to its present location. Cost of inventories is determined on a moving average. Finished goods and work-in-progress include \\nappropriate proportion of manufacturing overheads at normal capacity and where applicable, duty\\n. Net realisable value represents \\nthe estimated selling price for inventories less all estimated costs of completion and costs necessary to make the sale.\\n3.16\\n Pr\\novisions\\n Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that the Company will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.\\n The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. When a provision is measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present v\\nalue of those \\ncash flows (when the effect of the time value of money is material).\\n W\\narranties\\n The estimated liability for product warranties is recorded when products are sold. These estimates are established using historical information on the nature, frequency and a\\nverage cost of warranty claims and \\nmanagement estimates regarding possible future incidence based on corrective actions on product failures. The timing of outflows will vary as and when warranty claim will arise.\\n Onerous contracts\\n An onerous contract is a contract under which the unav\\noidable costs (i.e., the costs \\nthat the Company cannot avoid because it has the contract) of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it. The unavoidable costs under a contract reflect the least net cost of exiting from the contract, which is the lower of the cost of fulfilling it and any compensation or penalties arising from failure to fulfil it. The cost of fulfilling a contract comprises the costs that relate directly to the contract (i.e., both incremental costs \\n239\\nNOTES\\nFORMING PART OF THE STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2023\\nALL AMOUNTS ARE IN RS. CRORES UNLESS OTHERWISE STATED\\nINTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2022-23\\nand an allocation of costs directly related to \\ncontract activities).\\n Contingent liabilities\\n A disclosure for a contingent liability is made when there is a possible obligation or a present obligation that may, but probably will not, require an outflow of resources. When the likelihood of outflow of resources is remote, no provision or disclosure is made.\\n3.17\\n Financial instruments\\n A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity.\\n Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instruments.\\n Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value. T\\nransaction costs \\nthat are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are recognised immediately in profit or loss.\\n3.18\\n Financial assets\\n All recognised financial assets are subsequently measured in their entirety at either amortised cost or fair value through profit and loss or fair v\\nalue through other comprehensive \\nincome, depending on the classification of the financial assets.\\n  Classification of financial assets\\n Debt instruments that meet the following conditions are subsequently measured at amortised cost (except for debt instruments that are designated at fair value through profit or loss on initial recognition):\\n \\uf077 \\n the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets in order to collect contractual cash flows; and \\uf077  the contractual terms of the instrument \\ngive rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\\n Debt instruments that meet the following conditions are subsequently measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (“FVTOCI”) (except for debt instruments that are designated at fair v\\nalue through profit or loss on \\ninitial recognition):\\n \\uf077 \\n the asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved both by collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets; and\\n \\uf077 \\n the contractual terms of the instrument give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\\n Interest income is recognised in profit or loss for FVTOCI debt instruments.\\n All other financial assets are subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss.\\n  Effective interest method\\n The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a debt instrument and of allocating interest income over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts (including all fees and points paid or received that form an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts) through the expected life of the debt instrument, or\\n, where \\nappropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount on initial recognition.\\n Income is recognised on an effective interest basis for debt instruments other than those financial assets classified at FVTPL.

In addition, debt instruments that meet the amortised cost criteria or the FVTOCI criteria but are designated at FVTPL are measured at FVTPL.\\n A financial asset that meets the amortised cost criteria or debt instruments that meet the FVTOCI criteria may be designated at FVTPL upon initial recognition if such designation eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would arise from measuring assets or liabilities or recognising the gains and losses on them on different bases.\\n Financial assets at FVTPL are measured at fair value at the end of each reporting period, with any gains or losses arising on re-measurement recognised in profit or loss. The net gain or loss recognised in profit or loss incorporates any dividend or interest earned on the financial asset and is included in the \\'Other income\\' line item. Dividend on financial assets at FVTPL is recognised when the Company\\'s right to receive the dividends is established, it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the dividend will flow to the entity\\n, the dividend does \\nnot represent a recovery of part of cost of the investment and the amount of dividend can be measured reliably.\\n Investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures are carried at cost in the separate financial statements.\\n  Impairment of financial assets\\n The Company applies the expected credit loss model for recognising impairment loss on financial assets measured at amortised cost, debt instruments at FVTOCI, trade receivables, other contractual rights to receive cash or other financial asset, and financial guarantees not designated at FVTPL. The Company measures the loss allowance for \\na financial instrument at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit losses if the credit risk on that financial instrument has increased significantly since initial recognition.\\n Further, for the purpose of measuring lifetime expected credit loss allow\\nance for trade \\nreceivables, the Company has used a practical expedient as permitted under Ind AS 109. This expected credit loss allowance is computed based on historical credit loss experience and adjustments for forward looking information.\\n  Derecognition of financial assets\\n The Company derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another party\\n.\\n 3.19  \\n Financial liabilities and equity instruments\\n  Classification as financial liability or equity\\n Debt and equity instruments issued by Company are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangements and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument.\\n  Equity \\ninstruments\\n An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities.\\n  Financial \\nliabilities\\n Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial liabilities held for trading and financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair v\\nalue through profit or \\nloss. Financial liabilities are classified as held for trading if they are incurred for the purpose of repurchasing in the near term.\\n Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognised in the profit or loss.\\n Financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss are designated as such at the initial date of recognition, and only if the criteria in Ind AS 109 are satisfied.

These gains/ loss are not subsequently transferred to P&L. However, the Company may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity. All other changes in fair value of such liability are recognised in the statement of profit or loss.\\n The carrying amounts of financial liabilities that are subsequently measured at amortised cost are determined based on the effective interest method. Interest expense that is not capitalised as part of cost of an asset is included in the \\'Finance costs\\' line item.\\n The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments (including all fees and points paid or received that form an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts) through the expected life of the financial liability\\n.\\n All financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method or at FVTPL.\\n  Derecognition of financial liabilities\\n The Company derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Company’s obligations \\nare discharged, cancelled or ha\\nve expired.\\n 3.20  \\n Derivative Instruments and hedge accounting\\n  \\n Initial recognition and subsequent measurement\\n The Company uses derivative financial instruments, such as for\\nward currency \\ncontracts to hedge its foreign currency risks. Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as financial assets when the fair value is positive and as financial liabilities when the fair value is negative. Any gains or losses arising from changes in the \\nfair value of deriv\\natives are taken directly to \\nprofit or loss, except for the effective portion of cash flow hedges, which is recognised in OCI and later reclassified to profit or loss when the hedge item affects profit or loss or treated as basis adjustment if a hedged forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or non-financial liability.\\n For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as:\\n - \\n Fair v\\nalue hedges when hedging the \\nexposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability or an unrecognised firm commitment\\n -  \\n Cash flow hedges when hedging the exposure to variability in cash flows that is either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction or the foreign currency risk in an unrecognised firm commitment\\n - \\n Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation\"\\n At the inception of a hedge relationship, the Company formally designates and documents the hedge relationship to which the Company wishes to apply hedge accounting and the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge.\\n The documentation includes identification of the hedging instrument, , the hedged item, the nature of the risk being hedged, and how the Company will assess whether the hedging relationship meets the hedge effectiveness requirements (including the analysis of sources of hedge ineffectiveness and how the hedge ratio is determined). A hedging relationship qualifies for hedge accounting if it meets all of the following effectiveness requirements:\\n \\uf077 \\n There is ‘an economic relationship’ between the hedged item and the hedging instrument.\\n242\\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS (STANDALONE)\\nNOTES\\nFORMING PART OF THE STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2023\\nALL AMOUNTS ARE IN RS.

The Effective portion of cash flow hedges is adjusted to the lower of the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument and the cumulative change in fair value of the hedged item.\\n  \\n The Company uses forw\\nard currency \\ncontracts as hedges of its exposure to foreign currency risk in forecast transactions and firm commitments, as well as forward commodity contracts for its exposure to volatility in the commodity prices. The ineffective portion relating to foreign currency contracts is recognised in finance costs and the ineffective portion relating to commodity contracts is recognised in other income or expenses.\\n  \\n The Company designates only the spot element of a forw\\nard contract as a \\nhedging instrument. The forward element is recognised in OCI.\\n  \\n The amounts accumulated in OCI are accounted for, depending on the nature of the underlying hedged transaction. If the hedged transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a non-financial item, the amount accumulated in equity is removed from the separate component of equity \\nand included in the initial cost or other carr\\nying amount of the hedged asset \\nor liability. This is not a reclassification adjustment and will not be recognised in OCI for the period. This also applies where the hedged forecast transaction of a non-financial asset or non-financial liability subsequently becomes a firm commitment for which fair value hedge accounting is applied.\\n  \\n For any other cash flow hedges, the amount accumulated in OCI is reclassified to profit or loss as reclassification adjustment in the same period or periods during which the hedged cash flows affect profit or loss.\\n  \\n If cash flow hedge accounting is discontinued, the amount that has been accumulated in OCI must remain in accumulated OCI if the hedged future cash flows are still expected to occur. Other\\nwise, the amount will be \\nimmediately reclassified to profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment. After discontinuation, once the hedged cash flow occurs, any amount remaining in accumulated OCI must be accounted for depending on the nature of the underlying transaction as described above.\"\\n 3.21  Cash and cash equivalent\\n Cash and cash equivalent in the balance sheet comprise cash at banks and on hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less, which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in v\\nalue.\\n For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equiv\\nalents consist of cash and \\nshort-term deposits, as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts as they are considered an integral part of the Company’s cash management.\\n 3.22  Cash flow statement\\n Cash flows are reported using the indirect method, whereby profit / (loss) before tax is adjusted for the effects of transactions of \\n243\\nNOTES\\nFORMING PART OF THE STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2023\\nALL AMOUNTS ARE IN RS.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND KEY  SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY\\nIn the application of the Company accounting policies, which are described in note 3, the management of the Company are \\nrequired to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in \\nthe period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\\nThe following are the areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgements that the management has made in the process \\nof applying the Company’s accounting policies and that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements:-\\nRecoverability of intangible assets and intangible assets under development \\nThe Company has various internally generated intangible assets either capitalised or under development. Initial recognition of the expenditure under these assets are based on assessing each asset in relation to the specific recognition criteria to be met for capitalisation, for e.g. technological and economic feasibility and the ability of the asset to generate economic benefits in the future. In addition, the management also assesses any indications of impairment of the carrying value of the assets. This requires the management\\'s judgement and assumptions, which are affected by future market or economic developments. The management has analysed the recognition criteria and future market conditions and is confident that these assets do not require any adjustments to their carrying value at the year end.\\nUseful lives of depreciable assets\\nManagement reviews the useful lives of depreciable assets at each reporting date. As at March 31, 2023 management assessed that the useful lives represent the expected utility of the assets to the Company . Further, there is no significant change in the \\nuseful lives as compared to previous year.\\nShare-based payments\\nEstimating fair value for share-based payment transactions requires determination of the most appropriate valuation model, which is dependent on the terms and conditions of the grant. This estimate also requires determination of the most appropriate inputs to the valuation model including the expected life of the share option, volatility and dividend yield and making assumptions about them. The assumptions and models used for estimating fair value for share-based payment transactions are disclosed in Note 49.\\nImpairment of non-financial assets\\nImpairment exists when the carrying value of an asset or cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. The fair value less costs of disposal calculation is based on available data from binding sales transactions, conducted at arm’s length, for similar assets or observable market prices less incremental costs for disposing of the asset. The value in use calculation is based on a discounted cash flow model.\\nEquity investments designated at FVTOCI\\nEquity instruments designated at fair value through OCI include investments in equity shares of Stark Future S.L.,. for a non-controlling interests of 11.48% (undiluted basis). This investment w as irrevocably designated at initial recognition as fair \\nvalue through OCI considering it to be strategic in nature.\\n40. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES\\nRevenue expenditure on research and development incurred and expensed off during the year through the appropriate heads of account aggregate Rs. 81.44 crores (March 31, 2022 : Rs. 70.10 crores). The capital expenditure incurred during the year for research and development purposes aggregate Rs. 228.13 crores (March 31, 2022 : Rs. 172.44 crores).\\n270\\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS (STANDALONE)\\nNOTES\\nFORMING PART OF THE STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2023\\nALL AMOUNTS ARE IN RS.

Defined benefit plans:\\nThe Defined benefit plan of the Company includes entitlement of gratuity and provident fund scheme.\\nThis plan typically expose the Company to actuarial risks such as: investment risk, interest rate risk , longevity risk and salar y risk\\nInvestment Risk The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated using a discount rate which is determined by reference to \\nmarket yields at the end of the reporting period on government bonds. \\nInterest Risk A decrease in the bond interest rate will increase the plan liability; however , this will be partially offset by an increase in the \\nreturn on the plan\\'s debt investments.\\nLongevity Risk The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the best estimate of the mortality of plan participants both during and after their employment. An increase in the life expectancy of the plan participants will increase the plan\\'s liability.\\nSalary Risk The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the future salaries of plan participants. As such, an increase in the salary of the plan participants will increase the plan\\'s liability.\\nThe most recent actuarial valuation of the plan assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligation were carried out \\nas at March 31, 2023 by Mr. K.K.Dharni (FIAI M.No. 00051), Fellow of the Institute of Actuaries of India. The present value of the defined benefit obligation, and the related current service cost, were measured using the projected unit credit method.\\nGratuity :\\nThe gratuity plan is governed by the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972.

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values:\\n-\\n Investments traded in active markets are determined by reference to quotes from the financial institutions; for example: Net \\nasset v\\nalue (NAV) for investments in mutual funds declared by mutual fund house.\\n- The fair value of bonds is based on quoted prices and market obser\\nvable inputs.\\n- Trad\\ne receivables, cash and cash equivalents, other bank balances, loans, other current financial assets, current borrowings, \\ntrade payables and other current financial liabilities: Approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.\\n- \\n Management uses its best judgment in estimating the fair v\\nalue of its financial instruments. However, there are inherent \\nlimitations in any estimation technique. Therefore, for substantially all financial instruments, the fair v alue estimates \\npresented above are not necessarily indicative of all the amounts that the Company could have realized or paid in sale transactions as of respective dates. As such, the fair value of the financial instruments subsequent to the respective reporting dates may be different from the amounts reported at each year end.\\n-\\n There were no transfers between Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 during the year and the previous year\\n.\\n48. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES\\nFinancial risk management objectivesThe Company\\'s management monitors and manages the financial risks relating to the operations of the Company . These risks \\ninclude market risk (including currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. \\'The management reviews cash resources, implements strategies for foreign currency exposures and ensuring market risk limit and policies.\\nThe Company does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including deriv ative financial instruments, for \\nspeculative purposes.Market risk\\nMarket risk is the risk of any loss in future earnings, in realizable fair values or in future cash flows that may result from a change in the price of a financial instrument. The Company\\'s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates risk/ liquidity risk which impact returns on investments. Market risk exposures are measured using sensitivity analysis.\\nForeign currency risk management\\nThe Company undertakes transactions denominated in foreign currencies; consequently, exposures to exchange rate fluctuations arise. The carrying amounts of the Company\\'s foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the end of the reporting period are as follows:\\n(Amount in foreign currency in crores)\\nForeign currency exposure As at March 31, 2023 As at March 31, 2022\\nForeign currency \\nmonetary assetsForeign currency \\nmonetary liabilitiesForeign currency \\nmonetary assetsForeign currency \\nmonetary liabilities\\nUSD  3.97  0.37  2.79  0.41 \\nEURO  2.68  0.10  2.41  0.04 \\nGBP  0.97  0.13  0.44  0.25 \\nJPY  -    3.83  -    10.04 \\nTHB  3.80  0.04  3.34  0.04 \\nOthers  -    0.02  -    0.01 \\n283\\nNOTES\\nFORMING PART OF THE STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2023\\nALL AMOUNTS ARE IN RS. CRORES UNLESS OTHERWISE STATED\\nINTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2022-23\\nForeign currency sensitivity\\nThe company uses the sensitivity rate of 5% when reporting foreign currency risk internally to key management personnel and represents management\\'s assessment of the reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates. The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a 5% change in foreign currency rates. In the opinion of the management, the sensitivity of increase or decrease of Rs. 31.27 crores (March 31, 2022: Rs. 20.59 crores) against the relevant foreign currencies is not material to the financial statements.\\nCredit risk management\\nCredit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Company . \\nFinancial instruments that are subject to concentrations of credit risk, principally consist of balance with banks, investments in debt instruments/ bonds, trade receivables, loans and advances. None of the financial instruments of the Company result in material concentrations of credit risks.\\nBalances with banks were not past due or impaired as at the year end. In other financial assets that are not past dues and not \\nimpaired, there were no indication of default in repayment as at the year end.\\nThe Company has used a practical expedient by computing the expected loss allow ance for financial assets based on historical \\ncredit loss experience and adjustments for forward looking information.Movement in the expected credit loss allowance of financial assets\\nParticulars For the year ended  \\nMarch 31, 2023For the year ended  \\nMarch 31, 2022\\nBalance at beginning of the year  20.10  18.74 \\nAdd: Provided during the year  6.63  1.38 \\nLess: Amounts written off  -    0.02 \\nBalance at end of the year  26.73  20.10 \\nOther price risks including interest rate risk\\nThe Company has deployed its surplus funds into various financial instruments including units of mutual funds, bonds, etc. The Company is exposed to NAV (net asset value) price risks arising from investments in these funds. The value of these investments is impacted by movements in interest rates, liquidity and credit quality of underlying securities.\\nNAV price sensitivity analysis\\nThe sensitivity analysis below have been determined based on the exposure to NAV price risks at the end of the reporting period. If NAV prices had been 1% higher/lower, the profit for the year ended March 31, 2023 would increase/decrease by Rs. 91.87 crores (for the year ended March 31, 2022: increase/decrease by Rs. 53.90 crores).\\nInterest rate risk\\nInterest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rate. Since the Company\\'s borrowings which are affected by interest rate fluctuation is ver y insignificant to the \\nsize and operations of the Company, therefore, a change in interest rate risk does not have a material impact on the Company\\'s financial statements in relation to fair value of financial instruments.\\nLiquidity risk\\nThe Company manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities, by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows, and by matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.\\n284\\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS (STANDALONE)\\nNOTES\\nFORMING PART OF THE STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2023\\nALL AMOUNTS ARE IN RS.

Our responsibilities under those Standards are further \\ndescribed in the ‘Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements’ section of our report. We are independent of the Group, and its joint ventures in accordance with the ‘Code of Ethics’ issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements.\\nKey Audit Matters\\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements for the financial year ended March 31, 2023. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context.\\nWe have determined the matters described below to be \\nthe key audit matters to be communicated in our report. We have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements section of our report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements. The results of audit procedures performed by us and by other auditors of components not audited by us, as reported by them in their audit reports furnished to us by the management, including those procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\\nINDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT\\n298\\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONSOLIDATED)\\nEICHER MOTORS LIMITED\\nKey audit matters How our audit addressed the key audit matter\\nIntangible assets capitalized or under development (Refer to the accounting estimates and judgements in Note 3 and Note 7 to \\nthe Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements)\\nThe Group has various internally generated intangible projects \\nunder development or capitalized. Initial recognition of the expenditure under these projects are based on assessing each project in relation to specific recognition criteria that needs to be met for capitalization. In addition, the management also assess indication of impairment of the carrying value of assets which requires management judgment and assumptions as affected by future market or economic developments. \\nDue to the materiality of the assets capitalized or under \\ndevelopment and the level of management judgement involved, initial recognition and measurement and valuation of internally generated intangible assets has been considered as a key audit matter.\\uf077\\n \\n We read the Group\\'s research and development expenditure accounting policies to assess compliance with Ind AS 38 “Intangible Assets”.\\n\\uf077\\n \\n We performed test of control\\n over management \\nprocess of identifying and capitalizing the development expenditure in accordance with the accounting principles of capitalization of expenditure on internally generated intangible assets as per Ind AS 38 such as technical feasibility of the project, intention and ability to complete the intangible asset, ability to use or sell the asset, generation of future economic benefits and the ability to measure costs reliably.\\n\\uf077\\n \\n We performed test of details of development expenditure capitalized by reviewing the key assumptions including the authorization of the stage of the project in the development phase and the accuracy of costs included and assessing the useful economic life attributed to the asset. \\nIn addition, we considered whether any indicators of \\nimpairment were present by understanding the business rationale for projects.\\n\\uf077\\n \\n We tested th\\ne disclosure relating to research and \\ndevelopment expenditure in the Consolidated Financial Statements\\nRevenue Recognition (Refer to the accounting policies in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements)\\nRevenue from the sale of goods is recognised upon the \\ntransfer of control of the goods to the customer, usually on delivery of goods. The Group uses a variety of shipment terms across its operating markets and this has an impact on the timing of revenue recognition. There is a risk that revenue could be recognised in the incorrect period for sales transactions occurring on and around the year end and therefore revenue recognition has been considered as a key audit matter.Our audit procedures included the following:\\n\\uf077\\n \\n We read the Group\\'s revenue\\n recognition accounting \\npolicies to assess compliance with Ind AS 115 “Revenue \\nfrom contracts with customers”. \\n\\uf077 \\n We performed test of control\\ns of management’s process \\nof recognizing the revenue from sales of goods with regard to the timing of the revenue recognition as per the sales terms with the customers.\\n\\uf077\\n \\n We performed test of details of the sales transactions testing based on a representative sampling of the sales orders to ensure that the related revenues and trade receiv\\nables are recorded taking into consideration the \\nterms and conditions of the sale orders, including the shipping terms. \\n\\uf077\\n \\n We also performed audit procedures relating to revenue recognition by agreeing deliveries occurring around the year end to supporting documentation including dealers’ confirmations, where necessar\\ny, to establish that \\nsales and corresponding trade receivables are properly recorded in the correct period.\\n299\\nINTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2022-23\\nOTHER INFORMATION\\nThe Holding Company’s Board of Directors is responsible \\nfor the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Annual report, but does not include the consolidated financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.\\nOur opinion on the consolidated financial statements does \\nnot cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\\nIn connection with our audit of the consolidated financial \\nstatements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether such other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\\nRESPONSIBILITIES OF MANAGEMENT FOR THE \\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\nThe Holding Company’s Board of Directors is responsible \\nfor the preparation and presentation of these consolidated financial statements in terms of the requirements of the Act that give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position, consolidated financial performance including other comprehensive income, consolidated cash flows and consolidated statement of changes in equity of the Group including its joint ventures in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the Indian Accounting  Standards (Ind AS) specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended. The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and of its  joint ventures are responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of their respective companies and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, which have been used for the purpose of preparation of the consolidated financial statements by the Directors of the Holding Company, as aforesaid.\\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, the \\nrespective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and of its joint ventures are responsible for assessing the ability of their respective companies to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\\nThose respective Board of Directors of the companies \\nincluded in the Group and of its joint ventures are also responsible for overseeing the financial reporting process of their respective companies.\\nAUDITOR’S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR \\nTHE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about \\nwhether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\\nAs part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise \\nprofessional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\\n\\uf077\\n Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement \\nof the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error\\n, design and perform audit procedures \\nresponsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\\n\\uf077\\n Obtain an understanding of internal control relev\\nant to \\nthe audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Holding Company has adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.\\n\\uf077\\n Evaluate the\\n appropriateness of accounting policies \\nused and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\\n\\uf077\\n Conclude on the appropriateness of management’\\ns use \\nof the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the ability of the Group and its joint ventures to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we \\n300\\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONSOLIDATED)\\nEICHER MOTORS LIMITED\\nare required to draw attention in our auditor’s report \\nto the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group and its joint ventures to cease to continue as a going concern.\\n\\uf077\\n Evaluate the\\n overall presentation, structure and content \\nof the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\\n\\uf077\\n Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group and its joint ventures of which we are the independent auditors and whose financial information we have audited, to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements.

For the other entities included in the consolidated financial statements, which have been audited by other auditors, such other auditors remain responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audits carried out by them. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\\nWe communicate with those charged with governance of the Holding Company and such other entities included in the consolidated financial statements of which we are the independent auditors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a \\nstatement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with \\ngovernance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements for the financial year ended March 31, 2023 and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of \\nsuch communication.\\nOTHER MATTER\\n(a) We did not audit the financial statements and other financial information, in respect of tw \\no subsidiaries whose \\nfinancial statements include total assets of Rs 309.91 crores as at March 31, 2023, and total revenues of Rs 381.49 crores and net cash inflows of Rs 2.50 crores for the year ended on that date. These financial statement and other financial information have been audited by other auditors, which financial statements, other financial information and auditor’s reports have been furnished to us by the management.

CRORES UNLESS OTHERWISE STATED\\nINTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2022-23\\n1.  CORPORATE INFORMA TION\\n Eicher Motors Limited (“the Holding Company”) is a \\npublic Company domiciled and incorporated under the provisions of the Companies Act, 1956. The Holding Company and its subsidiaries (hereinafter referred to as “the Group”) are engaged in the manufacturing and selling of motorcycles, spare parts and related services. The Holding Company has its registered office at New Delhi, India and its corporate office at Gurugram, Har\\nyana, India. The Group is a leading \\ntwo wheeler manufacturer and has a dominant presence in domestic market. The consolidated financial statements were authorized for issue in accordance with a resolution of the Board of Directors on May 11, 2023.\\n2.   BASIS OF PREPARA TION \\nAND PRESENTATION\\n2.1 Statement of Compliance\\n The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) notified under section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read with Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended and the presentation requirements of Division II of Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013, (Ind AS compliant Schedule III), as applicable to the consolidated financial statements.\\n The Group \\nhas prepared the financial statements \\non the basis that it will continue to operate as a going concern.\\n2.2\\n Accounting convention\\n The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for certain financial instruments that are measured at fair v\\nalues at the end of each \\nreporting period, as explained in the accounting policies below. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for goods and services. The consolidated financial statements are presented in Indian Rupees and all values are rounded to the nearest two decimals of crore, except otherwise indicated.\\n2.3 \\n Operating Cycle\\n Based on the nature of products/ activities of the Group and the normal time between acquisition of assets and their realization in cash or cash equivalents, the Group has determined \\nits operating cycle as 12 months for the purpose of classification of its assets and liabilities as current and non-current.\\n3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\\n3.1  Basis of Consolidation\\n The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Holding Company and entities jointly controlled by the Holding Company and its subsidiaries. Control is achieved when the Company:\\n \\uf077 has power over the investee;\\n \\uf077 \\n is exposed, or has rights, to variable return from its inv\\nolvement with \\nthe investee; and\\n \\uf077 \\n has the ability to use its power to affect its returns.\\n The Group reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control listed above.\\n When the Group has less than a majority of the voting rights of an investee, it has power over the investee when the v\\noting rights are sufficient to \\ngive it the practical ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee unilaterally. The Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether or not the Group’s voting rights in an investee are sufficient to give it power, including:\\n\\t\\uf077\\n  The size of the Group’s holding of v\\noting \\nrights relative to the size and dispersion of holdings of the other vote holders.\\n\\t\\uf077\\n  Potential v\\noting rights held by the Group, \\nother vote holders or other parties; rights arising from other contractual arrangements; and\\n\\t\\uf077\\n  Any additional facts and circumstances that indicate that the Group has, or does not ha\\nve, the current ability to \\ndirect the relevant activities at the time that decisions need to be made, including voting patterns at previous shareholders\\' meetings.\\n312\\nNOTES\\nFORMING PART OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2023\\nALL AMOUNTS ARE IN RS. CRORES UNLESS OTHERWISE STATEDFINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONSOLIDATED)\\nEICHER MOTORS LIMITED\\n Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the \\nGroup obtains control over the subsidiar\\ny and \\nceases when the Group loses control of the subsidiary. Specifically, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated statement of profit and loss from the date the Group gains control until the date when the Group ceases to control the subsidiary.\\n Consolidated financial statements are prepared using uniform accounting policies for like transactions and other events in similar circumstances. If a member of the group uses accounting policies other than those adopted in the consolidated financial statements for like transactions and events in \\nsimilar circumstances, \\nappropriate adjustments are made to that group member’s financial statements in preparing the consolidated financial statements to ensure conformity with the Group’s accounting policies.\\n The financial statements of all entities used for the purpose of consolidation are drawn up to same reporting date as that of the parent \\ncompany \\n, i.e., year ended March 31, 2023. \\nWhen the end of the reporting period of the parent is different from that of a subsidiary, the subsidiary prepares, for consolidation purposes, additional financial information as of the same date as the financial statements of the parent to enable the parent to consolidate the financial information of the subsidiary.\\n Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income are attributed to the owners of the Group and to the non-controlling interests. T\\notal comprehensive income of \\nsubsidiaries is attributed to the owners of the Group and to the non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.\\n All intragroup assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses, and cash flows relating to transactions between members of the Group are eliminated in full on consolidation.\\n The following subsidiary companies are considered in the consolidated financial statements:\\nName of the Company Country of\\nIncorporationVoting power \\nheld as at\\nMarch 31, 2023Voting power held \\nas at\\nMarch 31, 2021\\nRoyal Enfield North America Limited (RENA)(Incorporated on March 23, 2015)U.S.A 100% 100%\\nRoyal Enfield Brasil Comercio De Motocicletas L TDA(Incorporated on August 18, 2014)Brazil 99.99% 99.99%\\nRoyal Enfield Canada Limited(100% subsidiary Company of RENA) (Incorporated on April 19, 2016)Canada 100% 100%\\nRoyal Enfield (Thailand) Limited (RET)(Incorporated on September 18, 2018)Thailand 99.99% 99.99%\\nRoyal Enfield (UK) Limited (REUK)(Incorporated on August 20, 2019)United Kingdom 100% 100%\\n 3.2 Investment in Joint ventures\\n A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby \\nthe parties that have joint control of the arrangement ha\\nve rights to the net assets \\nof the joint arrangement. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. The considerations made in determining whether \\nsignificant influence or joint control are similar to those necessary to determine control over the subsidiaries.\\n The results, assets and liabilities of joint ventures are incorporated in these consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method, an investment in a joint venture is initially recognised in the consolidated balance sheet \\n313\\nNOTES\\nFORMING PART OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2023\\nALL AMOUNTS ARE IN RS. CRORES UNLESS OTHERWISE STATED\\nINTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2022-23\\nat cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise \\nthe Group\\'s share of the profit or loss and other comprehensive income of the joint venture.\\n Distributions received from a joint venture reduce the carrying amount of the investment. When the Group\\'s share of losses of a joint venture exceeds the Group\\'s interest in that joint venture (which includes any long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the Group\\'s net investment in the joint venture), the Group discontinues recognising its share of further losses. Additional losses are recognised only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint venture.\\n After application of the equity method of accounting, the Group determines whether there any is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the net investment in \\na joint venture and that event (or events) has an impact on the estimated future cash flows from the net investment that can be reliably estimated. If there exists such an objective evidence of impairment, then it is necessar\\ny to \\nrecognise impairment loss with respect to the Group\\'s investment in a joint venture.\\n When necessary\\n, the entire carrying amount \\nof the investment (including goodwill) is tested for impairment in accordance with Ind AS 36 Impairment of Assets as a single asset by comparing its recoverable amount (higher of value in use and fair value less costs of disposal) with its carrying amount. Any impairment loss recognised forms part of the carrying amount of the investment.

CRORES UNLESS OTHERWISE STATEDFINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONSOLIDATED)\\nEICHER MOTORS LIMITED\\n 3.4 Fair V alue Measurement\\n The Group measures financial instruments, \\nsuch as, derivatives at fair v\\nalue at each \\nbalance sheet date.\\n Fair v\\nalue is the price that would be received to \\nsell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:\\n\\t\\uf077\\n  In the principal market for the asset or liability\\n, or\\n\\t\\uf077   In the absence of a principal market, in the most adv\\nantageous market for the \\nasset or liability\\n The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Group.\\n The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions, that market participants w\\nould use when pricing the asset or \\nliability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.\\n A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant’\\ns \\nability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use.\\n The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are a\\nvailable to measure \\nfair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.\\n All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair v\\nalue \\nhierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:\\n\\t\\uf077\\n  Level 1 — Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities\\t\\uf077  \\n  Level 2 — Valuation techniques for which \\nthe lowest level input that is significant to the fair v\\nalue measurement is directly or \\nindirectly observable\\n\\t\\uf077   \\n Level 3 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair v\\nalue measurement \\nis unobservable\\n For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers ha\\nve \\noccurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.\\n External valuers are inv\\nolved for valuation \\nof significant assets, such as properties and unquoted financial assets, and significant liabilities, such as contingent consideration. Involvement of external valuers is decided upon annually by the Group. Selection criteria include market knowledge, reputation, independence and whether professional standards are maintained. The Group decides, after discussions with the Group’s external valuers, which valuation techniques and inputs to use for each case.\\n At each reporting date, the Group analyses the movements in the values of assets and liabilities which are required to be remeasured or re-assessed as per the Group’\\ns accounting \\npolicies. For this analysis, the Group verifies the major inputs applied in the latest valuation by agreeing the information in the valuation computation to contracts and other relevant documents.\\n The Group also compares the change in the fair value of each asset and liability with relev\\nant \\nexternal sources to determine whether the change is reasonable.\\n 3.5  Revenue fr\\nom contract with customers\\n Revenue from contract with customers is recognised when control of the goods or services are transferred to the customer at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or ser\\nvices. The Group has \\n315\\nNOTES\\nFORMING PART OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2023\\nALL AMOUNTS ARE IN RS. CRORES UNLESS OTHERWISE STATED\\nINTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2022-23\\ngenerally concluded that it is the principal in its \\nrevenue arrangements, except for the agency services below, because it typically controls the goods or services before transferring them to the customer.\\n  Sale of goods\\n Revenue from sale of goods is recognised at the point in time when control of the goods is transferred to the customer, generally on deliver\\ny of the goods.\\n The Group considers whether there are other promises in the contract that are separate performance obligations to which a portion of the transaction price needs to be allocated (e.g., warranties, Road Side Assistance (RSA), F\\nree Service Coupons (FSC), etc.). \\nIn determining the transaction price for the sale of goods, the Group considers the effects of variable consideration, the existence of significant financing components, non-cash consideration, and consideration payable to the customer (if any).\\n  V\\nariable consideration\\n If the consideration in a contract includes a variable amount, the Group estimates the amount of consideration to which it will be entitled in exchange for transferring the goods to the customer\\n. The variable consideration \\nis estimated at contract inception and constrained until it is highly probable that a significant revenue reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur when the associated uncertainty with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. Some contracts for the sale of traded goods provide customers with a right of return for which, the consideration is estimated based on goods expected to be returned. The rights of return give rise to variable consideration. For goods that are expected to be returned, instead of revenue, the Group recognises a refund liability.\\n  W\\narranty obligations\\n The Group typically provides warranties for general repairs of defects that existed at the time of sale, as required by la\\nw. \\nThese assurance-type warranties are accounted for under Ind AS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets. Refer to the \\naccounting policy on warranty provisions in section 3.18 Provisions.\\n The Group provides a one to three years warranty bey\\nond fixing defects that existed at \\nthe time of sale. These service-type warranties are sold either separately or bundled together with the sale of goods. Contracts for bundled sales of goods and a service-type warranty comprise two performance obligations because the promises to transfer the goods and to provide the service-type warranty are capable of being distinct. Using the relative stand-alone selling price method, a portion of the transaction price is allocated to the service-type warranty and recognised on the service-type warranty to the extent of actual cost incurred on rendering the warranty service.\\n  Agency \\nservices\\n In contracts where the Group acts as an agent, the revenue is recorded at the net amount that the Group retains for its agency services.\\n  T\\nrade receivables\\n A receivable represents the Group’\\ns right to an \\namount of consideration that is unconditional (i.e., only the passage of time is required before payment of the consideration is due). Refer to accounting policies of financial assets in section 3.19 Financial instruments – initial recognition and subsequent measurement.\\n  Contract \\nliabilities\\n A contract liability is the obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the Group has received consideration (or an amount of consideration is due) from the customer\\n. If a customer pays consideration \\nbefore the Group transfers goods or services to the customer, a contract liability is recognised when the payment is made or the payment is due (whichever is earlier). Contract liabilities are recognised as revenue when the Group performs under the contract.\\n  Dividend and interest income\\n Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholder\\'s right to receive payment has been established.\\n316\\nNOTES\\nFORMING PART OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2023\\nALL AMOUNTS ARE IN RS. CRORES UNLESS OTHERWISE STATEDFINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONSOLIDATED)\\nEICHER MOTORS LIMITED\\n Interest income from a financial asset is \\nrecognised when it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the amount of income can be measured reliably. Interest income is accrued on, time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that asset\\'s net carr\\nying \\namount on initial recognition.\\n 3.6 Leases\\n The Group assesses at the contract inception, whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. That is, if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.\\n  As a lessee\\n The Group applies a single recognition and measurement approach for all leases, except for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets. The Group recognises lease liabilities to make lease payments and right-of-use assets representing the right to use the underlying assets.\\n  i) Right-of-use assets\\n  \\n The Group recognises right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date the underlying asset is av\\nailable for use). Right-of-use assets are \\nmeasured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any re-measurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received. Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:\\nParticulars Useful life (in years)\\nBuildings 2 to 25 years\\nOthers 99 years  \\n If ownership of the leased asset transfers \\nto the Group at the end of the lease term or the cost reflects the exercise of a purchase option, depreciation is calculated using the estimated useful life of the asset.\\n  \\n The right-of-use assets are also subject to impairment. Refer to the accounting policies in section 3.15 Impairment of non-financial assets.\\n  ii)  Lease Liabilities\\n  \\n At the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognises lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receiv\\nable, variable lease payments \\nthat depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. The lease payments also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by the Group and payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising the option to terminate. Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognised as expenses (unless they are incurred to produce inventories) in the period in which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs.\\n  \\n In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date because the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. A\\nfter the \\ncommencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the lease payments (e.g., changes to future payments resulting from a change \\n317\\nNOTES\\nFORMING PART OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2023\\nALL AMOUNTS ARE IN RS. CRORES UNLESS OTHERWISE STATED\\nINTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2022-23\\nin an index or rate used to determine \\nsuch lease payments) or a change in the assessment of an option to purchase the underlying asset.\\n  iii)  \\n Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets\\n  \\n The Group applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to its short-term leases of buildings and others (i.e., those leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the commencement date and do not contain a purchase option). Lease payments on short-term leases and leases of low-v\\nalue assets are \\nrecognised as expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\\n   As \\na lessor\\n  \\n Leases in which the Group transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an underlying asset are classified as finance leases.\\n  \\n Leases in which the Group does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an asset are classified as operating leases. Rental income arising is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease terms. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carr\\nying amount \\nof the leased asset and recognised over the lease term on the same basis as rental income. Contingent rents are recognised as revenue in the period in which they are earned.\\n  \\n In case of finance lease, as a lessor, the Group recognises, at the commencement date, assets held under a finance lease in its balance sheet and present them as a receiv\\nable at an amount equal to the \\nnet investment in the lease. Interest rate implicit is used to measure the net investment in the lease. Initial direct costs, other than those incurred by the Group, are included in the initial measurement of the net investment in the lease and reduce the amount of income recognised over the lease term. The interest rate implicit in the lease is arrived in such a way that the initial direct costs are included automatically in the net investment in the lease.\\n  \\n At the commencement date, the lease payments included in the measurement of the net investment in the lease comprise the following payments for the right to use the underlying asset during the lease term that are not received at the commencement date:\\n  \\n (a) fixed payments less any lease incentives payable, (b) v\\nariable lease \\npayments that depend on an index or a rate initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date; (c) any residual value guarantees provided to the lessor by the lessee, a party related to the lessee or a third party unrelated to the lessor that is financially capable of discharging the obligations under the guarantee, (d) the exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option and (e) payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising an option to terminate the lease.\\n  \\n At the commencement date, as a manufacturer or dealer the Group recognises the following for each of its finance leases:\\n  \\n (a) revenue being the fair value of the underlying asset, or\\n, if lower, the present \\nvalue of the lease payments accruing to the lessor, discounted using a market rate of interest; (b) the cost of sale being the cost, or carrying amount if different, of the underlying asset less the present value of the unguaranteed residual value; and (c) selling profit or loss (being the difference between revenue and the cost of sale) in accordance with its policy for outright sales to which Ind AS 115 applies. The Group also recognise selling profit or loss on a finance lease at the commencement date, regardless of whether the Group \\n318\\nNOTES\\nFORMING PART OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2023\\nALL AMOUNTS ARE IN RS. CRORES UNLESS OTHERWISE STATEDFINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONSOLIDATED)\\nEICHER MOTORS LIMITED\\ntransfers the underlying asset as \\ndescribed in Ind AS 115.\\n The Group as a manufacturer or dealer lessor recognises as an expense costs incurred in connection with obtaining a finance lease at the commencement date because they are mainly related to earning the manufacturer or dealer’s selling profit. Costs incurred by the Group in connection with obtaining a finance lease are excluded from the definition of initial direct costs and, thus, are excluded from the net investment in the lease.\\n  Subsequent \\nmeasurement:\\n The Group recognises finance income over the lease term, based on a pattern reflecting a constant periodic rate of return on the lessor’s net investment in the lease.\\n The finance income is allocated over the lease term on a systematic and rational basis. The Group applies the lease payments relating to the period against the gross investment in the lease to reduce both the principal and the unearned finance income. The Group applies the derecognition and impairment requirements in Ind AS 109 to the net investment in the lease. The Group reviews regularly estimated unguaranteed residual values used in computing the gross investment in the lease. If there has been a reduction in the estimated unguaranteed residual v\\nalue, the Group revises the income \\nallocation over the lease term and recognises immediately any reduction in respect of amounts accrued.\\n 3.7  For\\neign currencies\\n The financial statements are presented in Indian Rupees, which is also the functional currency of the Group. In preparing the financial statements of the Group, transactions in currencies other than the group\\'s functional currency (foreign currencies) are recognised at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions.\\n At the end of each reporting period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prev\\nailing at that date. Transactions in foreign currencies are initially \\nrecorded by the foreign operations at the functional currency spot rates at the date the transaction first qualifies for recognition. In respect of foreign operations, the assets and liabilities are translated into INR at the rate of exchange prev\\nailing at the reporting date and \\ntheir statement of profit and loss at the rates prevailing on the date of the transactions. However, for practical reasons, the Group uses an average rate to translate the income and expense items, if the average approximates the actual rate at the date of the transaction.\\n Exchange differences arising on settlement or translation of monetary items are recognised in the Statement of profit or loss with the exception of the following:\\n \\uf077  \\n Exchange differences arising on monetary items that forms part of a reporting entity’\\ns net investment in foreign \\noperations are initially recognised in the financial statements of the Group in the other comprehensive income. These exchange differences are reclassified from equity (Foreign currency translation reserve) to profit or loss on disposal of the net investment.\\n \\uf077  \\n Tax charges and credits attributable to exchange differences on those monetar\\ny \\nitems are also recorded in Other Comprehensive Income (OCI).\\n Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the dates of the initial transactions.\\n Non-monetary items measured at fair v\\nalue \\nin a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value is determined. The gain or loss arising on translation of non-monetary items measured at fair value is treated in line with the recognition of the gain or loss on the change in fair value of the item (i.e., translation differences on items whose fair value gain or loss is recognised in OCI or profit or loss are also recognised in OCI or profit or loss, respectively).\\n319\\nNOTES\\nFORMING PART OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2023\\nALL AMOUNTS ARE IN RS. CRORES UNLESS OTHERWISE STATED\\nINTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2022-23\\n 3.8  Borrowing costs\\n Borrowing costs directly attributable to the \\nacquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time that the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.\\n All other borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.\\n 3.9 Government grants\\n Government grants are not recognised until there is reasonable assurance that the Group will comply with the conditions attached to them and that the grants will be received. When the grant relates to an expense item, it is recognised as income on a systematic basis over the periods that the related costs, for which it is intended to compensate, are expensed.\\n When the Group receives grant of non-monetary assets, the asset and the grant are recorded at fair v\\nalue amounts and released \\nto the statement of profit and loss over the expected useful life in a pattern of consumption of the benefit of the underlying asset, i.e., by equal annual instalments.\\n In the case of Export Promotion Capital Goods (‘EPCG’) grant, the Group recognise the grant in the statement of profit and loss on a systematic basis over the useful life of the assets.\\n 3.10  Retirement and other employee benefits\\n  P\\nrovident fund\\n i.  \\n The Group operates a scheme of provident fund for eligible employees, which is a defined benefit plan. Both the employee and the Group make monthly contributions to the provident fund plan equal to a specified percentage of the covered employee’s salar\\ny. The Group \\ncontributes a part of the contributions to the “Eicher Executive Provident Fund Trust”. The rate at which the annual interest is payable to the beneficiaries by the trust is being administered by the Government. The Group has an obligation to make good the shortfall, if any, between the return from the investments \\nof the trust and the notified interest rate.\\n ii.  \\n The cost of providing benefits under above mentioned defined benefit plan is determined using the projected unit credit method with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date, which recognizes each period of ser\\nvice as giving rise to additional unit \\nof employee benefit entitlement and measures each unit separately to build up the final obligation.\\n iii.  \\n The employees, who are not covered under the scheme stated in 3.10 (i) above, are covered in a defined contribution scheme wherein their portion of provident fund is contributed to the government administered provident fund. The Group has no obligation, other than the contribution payable to the provident fund. The Group recognizes contribution pay\\nable to the provident fund scheme as \\nexpenditure, when an employee renders the related service.\\n  Gratuity\\n Payments to defined contribution plans are \\nrecognised as an expense when employees ha\\nve rendered service entitling them to \\nthe contributions.\\n For defined benefit plans, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial v\\naluations being \\ncarried out at the end of each annual reporting period. Re-measurement, comprising actuarial gains and losses and the return on plan assets (excluding net interest), is reflected immediately in the balance sheet with a charge or credit recognised in other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. Re-measurement recognised in other comprehensive income is reflected immediately in retained earnings and is not reclassified to profit or loss. Net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate at the beginning of the period to the net defined benefit liability or asset.\\n Defined benefit costs are categorised as follows:\\n \\uf077  \\n service cost (including current ser\\nvice \\ncost, past service cost, as well as \\n320\\nNOTES\\nFORMING PART OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2023\\nALL AMOUNTS ARE IN RS.

Any surplus resulting from this calculation is limited to the present v\\nalue of \\nany economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plans.\\n  \\n Short-term and other long-term employee benefits\\n A liability is recognised for benefits accruing to employees in respect of wages and salaries, in \\nthe period the related ser\\nvice is rendered at the \\nundiscounted amount of the benefits expected to be paid in exchange for that service.\\n Liabilities recognised in respect of short-term employee benefits are measured at the undiscounted amount of the benefits expected to be paid in exchange for the related service.\\n Liabilities recognised in respect of other long-term employee benefits such as annual leave and sick lea\\nve are measured at the present \\nvalue of the estimated future cash outflows expected to be made by the Group in respect of services provided by employees up to the reporting date.\\n 3.11  Share-based payment arrangements\\n Employees (including senior executives) of the Group receive remuneration in the form of share-based payments, whereby employees render services as consideration for equity \\ninstruments (equity-settled transactions).\\n Equity-settled share-based payments to employees are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments at the grant date. Details regarding the determination of the fair v\\nalue of equity-settled share-based \\ntransactions are set out in note no. 48.\\n That cost is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in share-based payment (SBP) reserves in equity\\n, over the \\nperiod in which the performance and/or service conditions are fulfilled in employee benefits expense. The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Group’s best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. The statement of profit and loss expense or credit for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that period and is recognised in employee benefits expense.\\n The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of diluted earnings per share.\\n 3.12  Taxation\\n Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.\\n  Current \\ntax\\n The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year\\n. Taxable profit differs from \\nprofit before tax as reported in the statement of profit and loss because of items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group\\'s current tax is calculated using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.\\n Current income tax relating to items recognised outside profit or loss is recognised outside profit or loss (either in other comprehensive income or in equity). Current tax items are recognised in correlation to the underlying transaction either in OCI or directly in equity. Management periodically ev\\naluates positions \\ntaken in the tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate.\\n321\\nNOTES\\nFORMING PART OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2023\\nALL AMOUNTS ARE IN RS.

Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives that are acquired separately are not amortised, but are tested for impairment annually, either individually or at the cash-generating unit level .\\n  \\n Internally-generated intangible assets - research and development expenditure\\n Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.\\n An internally-generated intangible asset arising from development (or from the development phase of an internal project) is recognised if, and only if\\n, all of the following have \\nbeen demonstrated:\\n323\\nNOTES\\nFORMING PART OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2023\\nALL AMOUNTS ARE IN RS.

Where no internally-generated intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is recognised in the statement of profit or loss in the period in which it is incurred.\\n Subsequent to initial recognition, internally-generated intangible assets are reported at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, on the same basis as intangible assets that are acquired separately.\\n  Derecognition of intangible assets\\n An intangible asset is derecognised on disposal, or when no future economic benefits are expected from use or disposal. Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset, measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset, and are recognised in the statement of profit or loss when the asset is derecognised.\\n  Useful lives of intangible assets\\n Intangible assets comprising of product design, prototypes, etc., either acquired or internally developed are amortised over a period of 5 to 10 years, the estimated minimum useful life of the related products. Cost of software is amortised over a period of 3 years or less \\ndepending on the estimated useful life of asset. The useful lives for intangible assets are given below:\\nParticulars Useful life (in years)\\nProduct designs, prototypes, \\netc.5 to 10\\nComputer software 3\\n 3.15  Impairment of non-financial assets\\n At the end of each reporting period, the Group \\nassesses, whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and v\\nalue in use.\\n When it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. When a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are also allocated to individual cash-generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest group of cash-generating units for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identified.\\n In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present v\\nalue using a pre-tax discount rate \\nthat reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. In determining fair value less costs of disposal, recent market transactions are taken into account. If no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used.\\n The Group bases its impairment calculation on detailed budgets and forecast calculations, which are prepared separately for each of the Group’s cash generating unit (CGU).\\n If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carr\\nying amount \\n324\\nNOTES\\nFORMING PART OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2023\\nALL AMOUNTS ARE IN RS. CRORES UNLESS OTHERWISE STATEDFINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONSOLIDATED)\\nEICHER MOTORS LIMITED\\nof the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced \\nto its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss. When an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or a cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss.\\n Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and intangible assets not yet av\\nailable for use are \\ntested for impairment at least annually, and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.\\n 3.16  Investment property\\n Investment property is a property held to earn rentals and capital appreciation. Investment property is measured initially at cost, including transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, investment property is measured in accordance with Ind AS 16’s requirements for cost model. The Group depreciates building component of investment property over 30 years from the date of capitalisation.\\n Investment properties are derecognised either when they have been disposed of or when they are permanently withdra\\nwn from use and no \\nfuture economic benefit is expected from their disposal. The difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset is recognised in profit or loss in the period of derecognition.\\n 3.17  Inventories\\n Inventories comprising Raw materials, w\\nork-in-\\nprogress, stores and spares, loose tools, traded goods and finished goods are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Costs of inventories are determined on a \\nmoving average.\\n Finished goods and work-in-progress include appropriate proportion of manufacturing overheads at normal capacity and where applicable, duty\\n. Net realisable value represents \\nthe estimated selling price for inventories less all estimated costs of completion and costs necessary to make the sale.\\n 3.18  Pr\\novisions\\n Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that the Group will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.\\n The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. When a provision is measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present v\\nalue of those \\ncash flows (when the effect of the time value of money is material).\\n  Onerous \\ncontracts\\n An onerous contract is a contract under which the unav\\noidable costs (i.e., the costs that the \\nGroup cannot avoid because it has the contract) of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it. The unavoidable costs under a contract reflect the least net cost of exiting from the contract, which is the lower of the cost of fulfilling it and any compensation or penalties arising from failure to fulfil it. The cost of fulfilling a contract comprises the costs that relate directly to the contract (i.e., both incremental costs and an allocation of costs directly related to contract activities).\\n  W\\narranties\\n The estimated liability for product warranties is recorded when products are sold. These estimates are established using historical information on the nature, frequency \\n325\\nNOTES\\nFORMING PART OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2023\\nALL AMOUNTS ARE IN RS. CRORES UNLESS OTHERWISE STATED\\nINTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2022-23\\nand average cost of warranty claims and \\nmanagement estimates regarding possible future incidence based on corrective actions on product failures. The timing of outflows will vary as and when warranty claim will arise.\\n  Contingent \\nliabilities\\n A disclosure for a contingent liability is made when there is a possible obligation or a present obligation that may, but probably will not, require an outflow of resources. When the likelihood of outflow of resources is remote, no provision or disclosure is made.\\n 3.19  Financial instruments\\n A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity.\\n Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instruments.\\n Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value. T\\nransaction costs \\nthat are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are recognised immediately in profit or loss.\\n 3.20  Financial assets\\n All recognised financial assets are subsequently measured in their entirety at either amortised cost or fair value through profit and loss or fair v\\nalue through other comprehensive \\nincome, depending on the classification of the financial assets.\\n  Classification of financial assets\\n Debt instruments that meet the following conditions are subsequently measured at amortised cost (except for debt instruments that are designated at fair value through profit or loss on initial recognition): \\uf077  the asset is held within a business model \\nwhose objective is to hold assets in order to collect contractual cash flows; and\\n \\uf077  \\n the contractual terms of the instrument give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\\n Debt instruments that meet the following conditions are subsequently measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (“FVTOCI”) (except for debt instruments that are designated at fair v\\nalue through profit or loss on \\ninitial recognition):\\n \\uf077 \\n the asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved both by collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets; and\\n \\uf077 \\n the contractual terms of the instrument give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\\n Interest income is recognised in profit or loss for FVTOCI debt instruments.\\n All other financial assets are subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss.\\n  Effective interest method\\n The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a debt instrument and of allocating interest income over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts (including all fees and points paid or received that form an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts) through the expected life of the debt instrument, or\\n, where \\nappropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount on initial recognition.\\n Income is recognised on an effective interest basis for debt instruments other than those financial assets classified at FVTPL. Interest income is recognised in profit or loss and is included in the \"Other income\" line item.\\n326\\nNOTES\\nFORMING PART OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2023\\nALL AMOUNTS ARE IN RS. CRORES UNLESS OTHERWISE STATEDFINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONSOLIDATED)\\nEICHER MOTORS LIMITED\\n   Financial assets at fair value through profit \\nor loss (FVTPL)\\n  Investments in equity instruments are classified at FVTPL, unless the Group irrevocably elects on initial recognition to present subsequent changes in fair v\\nalue in other comprehensive \\nincome for investments in equity instruments which are not held for trading.\\n Debt instruments that do not meet the amortised cost criteria or FVTOCI criteria are measured at \\nFVTPL. In addition, debt instruments \\nthat meet the amortised cost criteria or the FVTOCI criteria but are designated at FVTPL are measured at FVTPL.\\n A financial asset that meets the amortised cost criteria or debt instruments that meet the FVTOCI criteria may be designated at FVTPL upon initial recognition if such designation eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would arise from measuring assets or liabilities or recognising the gains and losses on them on different bases.\\n Financial assets at FVTPL are measured at fair value at the end of each reporting period, with any gains or losses arising on re-measurement recognised in profit or loss. The net gain or loss recognised in profit or loss incorporates any dividend or interest earned on the financial asset and is included in the \\'Other income\\' line item. Dividend on financial assets at FVTPL is recognised when the Group\\'s right to receive the dividends is established, it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the dividend will flow to the entity\\n, the dividend does \\nnot represent a recovery of part of cost of the investment and the amount of dividend can be measured reliably.\\n  Impairment of financial assets\\n The Group applies the expected credit loss model for recognising impairment loss on financial assets measured at amortised cost, debt instruments at FVTOCI, trade receivables, other contractual rights to receive cash or other financial asset, and financial guarantees not designated at FVTPL. The Group measures the loss allowance for \\na financial instrument at an amount equal to \\nthe lifetime expected credit losses if the credit risk on that financial instrument has increase significantly since initial recognition.\\n Further, for the purpose of measuring lifetime expected credit loss allow\\nance for trade \\nreceivables, the Group has used a practical expedient as permitted under Ind AS 109. This expected credit loss allowance is computed based on historical credit loss experience and adjustments for forward looking information.\\n  Derecognition of financial assets\\n The Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another party\\n.\\n 3.21  \\n Financial liabilities and equity instruments\\n  Classification as financial liability or equity\\n Debt and equity instruments issued by Group are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangements and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument.\\n  Equity \\ninstruments\\n An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities.\\n  Financial \\nliabilities\\n Financial liabilities that are not held-for-trading and are not designated as at FVTPL are measured at amortised cost at the end of subsequent accounting periods. The carrying amounts of financial liabilities that are subsequently measured at amortised cost are determined based on the effective interest method. Interest expense that is not capitalised as part of cost of an asset is included in the \\'Finance costs\\' line item.\\n The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments (including all fees and points \\n327\\nNOTES\\nFORMING PART OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2023\\nALL AMOUNTS ARE IN RS.

Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as financial assets when the fair value is positive and as financial liabilities when the fair value is negative.\\n Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of deriv\\natives are taken directly to \\nprofit or loss, except for the effective portion of cash flow hedges, which is recognised in OCI and later reclassified to profit or loss when the hedge item affects profit or loss or treated as basis adjustment if a hedged forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or non-financial liability.\"\\n For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as:\\n  - \\n Fair v\\nalue hedges when hedging the \\nexposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability or an unrecognised firm commitment\\n - \\n Cash flow hedges when hedging the exposure to variability in cash flows that is either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction or the foreign currency risk in an unrecognised firm commitment -   Hedges of a net investment in a \\nforeign operation\"\\n At the inception of a hedge relationship, the Group formally designates and documents the hedge relationship to which the Group wishes to apply hedge accounting and the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge.\\n The documentation includes identification of the hedging instrument, , the hedged item, the nature of the risk being hedged, and how the Group will assess whether the hedging relationship meets the hedge effectiveness requirements (including the analysis of sources of hedge ineffectiveness and how the hedge ratio is determined). A hedging relationship qualifies for hedge accounting if it meets all of the following effectiveness requirements:\\n \\uf077 \\n There is ‘an economic relationship’ between the hedged item and the hedging instrument.\\n \\uf077 \\n The effect of credit risk does not ‘dominate the value changes’ that result from that economic relationship.\\n \\uf077 \\n The hedge ratio of the hedging relationship is the same as that resulting from the quantity of the hedged item that the Group actually hedges and the quantity of the hedging instrument that the Group actually uses to hedge that quantity of hedged item. \"\\n Hedges that meet the strict criteria for hedge accounting are accounted for, as described below:\\n (i)  Cash flow hedges\\n The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in OCI in the Effective portion of cash flow hedges, while any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the statement of profit and loss. The Effective portion of cash flow hedges is adjusted to the lower of the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument and the cumulative change in fair value of the hedged item.\\n The Group uses forw\\nard currency contracts as \\nhedges of its exposure to foreign currency risk \\n328\\nNOTES\\nFORMING PART OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2023\\nALL AMOUNTS ARE IN RS. CRORES UNLESS OTHERWISE STATEDFINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONSOLIDATED)\\nEICHER MOTORS LIMITED\\nin forecast transactions and firm commitments, \\nas well as forward commodity contracts for its exposure to volatility in the commodity prices. The ineffective portion relating to foreign currency contracts is recognised in finance costs and the ineffective portion relating to commodity contracts is recognised in other income or expenses.\\n The Company designates only the spot element of a forw\\nard contract as a hedging instrument. \\nThe forward element is recognised in OCI.\\n The amounts accumulated in OCI are accounted for, depending on the nature of the underlying hedged transaction. If the hedged transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a non-financial item, the amount accumulated in equity is removed from the separate component of equity and included in the initial cost or other carr\\nying amount of the hedged asset or liability. \\nThis is not a reclassification adjustment and will not be recognised in OCI for the period. This also applies where the hedged forecast transaction of a non-financial asset or non-financial liability subsequently becomes a firm commitment for which fair value hedge accounting is applied.\\n For any other cash flow hedges, the amount accumulated in OCI is reclassified to profit or loss as reclassification adjustment in the same period or periods during which the hedged cash flows affect profit or loss.\\n If cash flow hedge accounting is discontinued, the amount that has been accumulated in OCI must remain in accumulated OCI if the hedged future cash flows are still expected to occur. Other\\nwise, the amount will be immediately \\nreclassified to profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment. After discontinuation, once the hedged cash flow occurs, any amount remaining in accumulated OCI must be accounted for depending on the nature of the underlying transaction as described above.\"\\n 3.23  Cash and cash equivalent\\n Cash and cash equivalent in the balance sheet comprise cash at banks and on hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less, which are subject to an \\ninsignificant risk of changes in v\\nalue.\\n For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equiv\\nalents consist of cash \\nand short-term deposits, as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts as they are considered an integral part of the Group’s cash management.\\n 3.24  Cash flow statement\\n Cash flows are reported using the indirect method, whereby profit / (loss) before tax is adjusted for the effects of transactions of non-cash nature and any deferrals or accruals of past or future cash receipts or payments. The cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities of the Group are segregated based on the av\\nailable information.\\n 3.25  Cash dividend\\n The Group recognises a liability to pay dividend to equity holders of the parent when the distribution is authorised and the distribution is no longer at the discretion of the Group. As per the corporate laws in India, a distribution is authorised when it is approved by the shareholders. However\\n, Board of Directors of a \\nCompany may declare interim dividend during any financial year out of the surplus in statement of profit and loss and out of the profits of the financial year in which such interim dividend is sought to be declared. A corresponding amount is recognised directly in equity.\\n 3.26  Earnings per share\\n Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing the profit after tax by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year\\n.\\n Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing the profit after tax as adjusted for dividend, interest and other charges to expense or income relating to the dilutive potential equity shares, by the weighted average number of equity shares considered for deriving basic earnings per share and the weighted a\\nverage \\nnumber of equity shares which could have been issued on the conversion of all dilutive potential equity shares.\\n329\\nNOTES\\nFORMING PART OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2023\\nALL AMOUNTS ARE IN RS.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENT AND KEY S OURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY\\nIn the application of the Group accounting policies, which are described in note 3, the management of the Group are required to \\nmake judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in \\nthe period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\\nThe following are the areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgements that the management has made in the process of \\napplying the Group’s accounting policies and that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements:-\\nControl over VE Commercial Vehicles Limited\\nVE Commercial Vehicles Limited (VECVL) is a joint venture Company of Eicher Motors Limited (EML) and Aktiebolaget Volvo (PUBL), Volvo (AB Volvo). EML holds 54.4% in VECVL, however, the composition of the Board of Directors for the management of VECVL is jointly controlled by both the investors i.e. EML and AB V olvo. Further, EML is also not meeting the criteria of control \\nas given in Ind-AS 110, for e.g. EML exposure/ right to variable returns from its involvement in VECVL, ability to use its power over VECV to affect the amount of returns, etc. and therefore, VECVL is considered as joint venture instead of a subsidiar y \\ncompany for EML.\\nThe arrangement shall be treated as a joint arrangement under Ind AS 111 “Joint Arrangements”.Ind AS 111 classifies joint arrangements into:\\uf077\\n \\n Joint operations whereby the parties ha\\nve joint control over the rights and obligations of the arrangement. It also includes \\nan arrangement which is not structured through a separate vehicle.\\n\\uf077 Joint venture whereby the parties ha\\nve joint control over the net assets of the arrangement.\\nJoint Control has been described to be existing only when decisions about relevant activities require the unanimous consent of \\nthe parties that collectively control the arrangement. The contractual arrangement requires a minimum proportion of the v oting \\nrights to make relevant decisions.\\nAs per the above description, the arrangement between EML and AB V olvo shall be classified as a Joint Venture as it has been \\nstructured through a separate vehicle (i.e. VECVL) and also the parties do not ha ve control over specific rights and obligations \\nrather they have joint control over the net assets.Recoverability of intangible assets and intangible assets under development\\nThe Group has various internally generated intangible assets either capitalised or under development. Initial recognition of the expenditure under these assets are based on assessing each asset in relation to the specific recognition criteria to be met for capitalisation, for e.g. technological and economic feasibility and the ability of the asset to generate economic benefits in the future. In addition, the management also assesses any indications of impairment of the carr ying value of the assets. \\nThis requires the management\\'s judgement and assumptions, which are affected by future market or economic developments. The management has analysed the recognition criteria and future market conditions and is confident that these assets do not require any adjustments to their carrying value at the year end.\\nUseful lives of depreciable assets\\nManagement reviews the useful lives of depreciable assets at each reporting date. As at March 31, 2023 management assessed that the useful lives represent the expected utility of the assets to the Group. Further , there is no significant change in the useful \\nlives as compared to previous year.\\n356\\nNOTES\\nFORMING PART OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2023\\nALL AMOUNTS ARE IN RS. CRORES UNLESS OTHERWISE STATEDFINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONSOLIDATED)\\nEICHER MOTORS LIMITED\\nShare-based payments\\nEstimating fair value for share-based payment transactions requires determination of the most appropriate valuation model, which is dependent on the terms and conditions of the grant. This estimate also requires determination of the most appropriate inputs to the valuation model including the expected life of the share option, volatility and dividend yield and making assumptions about them. The assumptions and models used for estimating fair v alue for share-based payment transactions are \\ndisclosed in Note 48.\\nImpairment of non-financial assets\\nImpairment exists when the carrying value of an asset or cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use.

Fair values are determined in whole or in part, using a valuation model based on assumptions that \\nare neither supported by prices from observable current market transactions in the same instrument nor are they based on available market data. \\nQuantitative disclosures fair value measurement hierarchy for assets:\\nThere are certain Group\\'s financial assets which are measured at fair v alue at the end of each reporting period.

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values:\\n-\\n \\n Investments traded in active markets are determined by reference to quotes from the financial institutions; for example: Net \\nasset v\\nalue (NAV) for investments in mutual funds declared by mutual fund house.\\n- The fair value of bonds is based on quoted prices and market obser\\nvable inputs.\\n- \\n Trad\\ne receivables, cash and cash equivalents, other bank balances, loans, other current financial assets, current borrowings, \\ntrade payables and other current financial liabilities: Approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.\\n-\\n \\n Management uses its best judgment in estimating the fair v\\nalue of its financial instruments. However, there are inherent \\nlimitations in any estimation technique. Therefore, for substantially all financial instruments, the fair v alue estimates \\npresented above are not necessarily indicative of all the amounts that the Group could have realized or paid in sale transactions as of respective dates. As such, the fair value of the financial instruments subsequent to the respective reporting dates may be different from the amounts reported at each year end.\\n-\\n There were no transfers between Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 during the year and the previous year\\n.\\n368\\nNOTES\\nFORMING PART OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2023\\nALL AMOUNTS ARE IN RS.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES\\nFinancial risk management objectives\\nThe Group\\'s management monitors and manages the financial risks relating to the operations of the Group. These risks include market risk (including currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk.\\nThe management reviews cash resources, implements strategies for foreign currency exposures and ensuring market risk \\nlimit and policies.\\nThe Group does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including deriv ative financial instruments, for speculative purposes.\\nMarket risk\\nMarket risk is the risk of any loss in future earnings, in realizable fair values or in future cash flows that may result from a change in the price of a financial instrument. The Group\\'s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates risk/ liquidity risk which impact returns on investments. Market risk exposures are measured using sensitivity analysis.\\nForeign currency risk management\\nThe Group undertakes transactions denominated in foreign currencies; consequently, exposures to exchange rate fluctuations arise. The carrying amounts of the Group\\'s foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the end of the reporting period are as follows:\\n(Amount in foreign currency in crores)\\nForeign currency exposure As at March 31, 2023 As at March 31, 2022\\nForeign currency \\nmonetary assetsForeign currency \\nmonetary liabilitiesForeign currency \\nmonetary assetsForeign currency \\nmonetary liabilities\\nUSD  3.97  2.95  2.79  1.23 \\nEURO  2.68  0.10  2.41  0.04 \\nGBP  0.97  0.13  0.44  0.25 \\nJPY  -    3.83  -    10.04 \\nTHB  3.80  0.04  3.34  0.04 \\nOthers  0.06  0.02  0.01  0.01 \\nForeign currency sensitivityThe Group uses the sensitivity rate of 5% when reporting foreign currency risk internally to key management personnel and represents management\\'s assessment of the reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates. The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a 5% change in foreign currency rates. In the opinion of the management, the sensitivity of increase or decrease of Rs. 20.85 crores (March 31, 2022: Rs. 17.52 crores) against the relevant foreign currencies is not material to the financial statements.\\nCredit risk management\\nCredit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.  \\nFinancial instruments that are subject to concentrations of credit risk, principally consist of balance with banks, investments in debt instruments/ bonds, trade receivables, loans and advances. None of the financial instruments of the Group result in material concentrations of credit risks.\"\\nBalances with banks were not past due or impaired as at the year end. In other financial assets that are not past dues and not \\nimpaired, there were no indication of default in repayment as at the year end.\\nThe Group has used a practical expedient by computing the expected loss allow ance for financial assets based on historical credit \\nloss experience and adjustments for forward looking information.\\n369\\nNOTES\\nFORMING PART OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2023\\nALL AMOUNTS ARE IN RS.

The value of these investments is impacted by movements in interest rates, liquidity and credit quality of underlying securities.\\nNAV price sensitivity analysis\\nThe sensitivity analysis below have been determined based on the exposure to NAV price risks at the end of the reporting period. If NAV prices had been 1% higher/lower, the profit for the year ended March 31, 2023 would increase/decrease by Rs. 91.87 crores (for the year ended March 31, 2022: increase/decrease by Rs. 53.90 crores).\\nInterest rate risk\\nInterest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rate. Since the Group\\'s borrowings which are affected by interest rate fluctuation is ver y insignificant to the size \\nand operations of the Group, therefore, a change in interest rate risk does not ha ve a material impact on the Group\\'s financial \\nstatements in relation to fair value of financial instruments.\\nLiquidity risk\\nThe Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities, by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows, and by matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities. \\nMaturity profile of financial liabilities:\\nParticulars As at March 31, 2023\\nLess than 1 year 1 to 5 years >5 Years Total\\nNon-current\\n (i) Borrowings  \\n-    -    62.96  62.96 \\n (ii) Lease liability  \\n-    71.84  10.49  82.33 \\n (iii) Other financial liabilities  \\n-    -    15.51  15.51 \\nCurrent\\n (i) Borrowings  132.7\\n4  -    -    132.74 \\n (ii) Lease liability   31.47  -    \\n-    31.47 \\n (iii) Trade pay\\nables  1,810.44  -    -    1,810.44 \\n (iv) Other financial liabilities  266.77  \\n-    -    266.77 \\n370\\nNOTES\\nFORMING PART OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2023\\nALL AMOUNTS ARE IN RS.
